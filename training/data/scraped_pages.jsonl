The subjects include\nearth science\n,\nbiology\n,\nchemistry\n,\nphysics\n, and\nengineering\n. Over 7,800\nmiddle school\nand\nhigh school\nteams from 50 U.S. states compete with each year.\n[\n1\n]\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\nThe U.S. territories do not compete. However, several international teams do compete in Science Olympiad tournaments in the U.S.\n[\n4\n]\nThere are multiple levels of the competition: invitational, regional, state, and national. Invitational tournaments, usually run by high schools and universities, are unofficial tournaments and serve as practice for regional and state competitions.\n[\n5\n]\nTeams that excel at regional competitions advance to the state level; the top one or two teams from each state (depending on the state) then advance the national level. Winners later receive several kinds of awards, including medals, trophies and plaques, as well as scholarships.\n[\n6\n]\nThe program for elementary-age students is less common and less consistent. Schools have flexibility to implement the program to meet their needs. Some communities host competitive elementary tournaments.\n[\n7\n]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThe first recorded Science Olympiad was held on Saturday, November 23, 1974, at\nSt. Andrews Presbyterian College\nin\nLaurinburg, North Carolina\n. Dr. Barnes and Dr. David Wetmore were the originators of this event. Fifteen schools from North and\nSouth Carolina\nparticipated in this event. It was a day-long affair, with competitions and demonstrations for high school students in the areas of biology, chemistry, and physics. There were four event periods during this day and each event period had one fun event (like beaker race or paper airplane), one demonstration (like glassblowing and holography), and one serious event (like periodic table quiz or Science Bowl). An article by David Wetmore was published in the\nJournal of Chemical Education\nin January 1978\n[\n8\n]\ndocumenting the success of recruiting students through Science Olympiad. St. Andrews Presbyterian College continues to host a Science Olympiad tournament to this day.\n[\n9\n]\nMr. John C. \"Jack\" Cairns was a teacher at\nDover High School\nin Delaware when he learned about the\nScience Olympiad tournament in North Carolina\n. He shared this information with Dr. Douglas R. Macbeth, the Delaware State Science Supervisor. Mr. Cairns was appointed to a steering committee to organize the first Science Olympiad in Delaware\n[\n10\n]\nwhich took place at\nDelaware State University\nin the Spring of 1977. A write-up in\nThe Science Teacher\nof December 1977 caught the attention of Gerard Putz, who proposed that the program be expanded throughout the United States. After competition tests in\nMichigan\nat the\nLawrence Institute of Technology\nand\nOakland University\nin 1983 and 1984, Putz and Delaware director John Cairns took their plan for a national competition to the\nNational Science Teachers Conference\nin\nBoston\n. The first National Tournament was attended by representatives of 17 states, held at\nMichigan State University\nin 1985. Since then, the program has expanded greatly, with 60 teams present in each division at the National Tournament.\n[\n2\n]\nInternational Teams\n[\nedit\n]\nSince 2012, a Global Ambassador Team from\nJapan\nhas been invited to attend the national tournament as part of a partnership between Science Olympiad,\nMEXT\nand\nJST\n. Each year, the Grand Prize for winning the\nJapan High School Science Championships\n(JHSSC), a competition styled after the U.S.-based Science Olympiad is a trip to the U.S. to participate in the Science Olympiad National Tournament. The Japanese Global Ambassador Team does however only compete on a limited basis as unranked guests.\n[\n11\n]\nJapan continues to send a team, as of the 2025 National Tournament.\n[\n12\n]\nThe Japanese Global Ambassador Teams are the best known international teams that participate in Science Olympiad however other countries do occasionally participate in tournaments.\nCanada has multiple active Science Olympiad teams and participated in the nationals tournaments in the U.S. between 1995 and 1998 but has not sent a team since although Canadian teams do still occasionally participate in tournaments in the U.S.\n[\n4\n]\nPeru also sends teams to the U.S. to compete in Science Olympiad tournaments but Peru has never attended a national tournament.\n[\n4\n]\nPeru's participation is for the most part coordinated by\nUnited Technologies for Kids\n(UTK) a\nNGO\nfocused on\nSTEM\neducation in Latin America.\n[\n13\n]\nDivisions\n[\nedit\n]\nThere are three divisions in the hierarchy of Science Olympiad:\n[\n14\n]\nDivision A for elementary school (grades K–6)\nDivision B for middle school (grades 5–9)\nDivision C for high school (grades 9–12)\nThe national tournament and generally state and regional tournaments are only for divisions B and C. Division A teams usually have separate interscholastic tournaments, apart from the more common intra-school competitions. Note that 6th and 9th graders have the option of competing in either of the two divisions in which they meet the grade requirements and are part of the competing school. (6th graders can compete in divisions A and B while 9th graders can compete in divisions B and C.) A middle school may, however, only use up to 2 members who have graduated to the next school if they are in 9th grade or lower. Students in grades lower than the division in which the school competes in may also be on the team. Teams are restricted to two 9th graders for division B and seven 12th graders for division C. Students may not participate on multiple teams, e.g. a 9th grader on both a high school and middle school team would not be allowed.\n[\n15\n]\nEvents and event history\n[\nedit\n]\nIn Divisions A, B and C, teams may compete in up to twenty-three main events, which usually occur over a single day (some tournaments, such as the Texas State tournament, run competitive events over multiple days); done by a team of no more than 15 members. Events fall into five main categories: Life, Personal, and Social Science, Earth & Space Science, Physical Science & Chemistry, Technology & Engineering, Inquiry & Nature of Science. They are either knowledge-based (for example, written tests on\nearth science\n,\nphysics\n,\nastronomy\n, or\nbiology\n), hands-on (for example,\nchemistry\nlab practicals or events involving both device testing and an exam), or engineering-based (participants construct a device before the competition to do specified tasks on the day of the competition).\n[\n16\n]\nKnowledge-based events generally have two to three participants taking a test and/or mathematically analyzing data. Examples of such events are Anatomy and Physiology, Meteorology, Codebusters, and Green Generation.\nHands-on events generally consist of two participants performing experiments or interacting with physical objects to achieve a certain goal. Some examples are Experimental Design and Write it Do it.\nEngineering-based events have a team of two participants. They are to construct a device following a specific event's parameters and test the device against others. Examples include Bridge, Flight, and Roller Coaster.\nThe majority of events allow two team members, though a few allow more. If one member is unable to attend an event, the other is able to continue, depending on the event. If the team has one available, a backup team member may be placed with the member as opposed to their former partner.\nThe list of events and rules for each change and are updated every year to input dynamism and to limit the advantages of more experienced teams. Events of each type often rotate, with each event staying in competition rotation for at least two years. For example, the Division C vehicle event cycle is two years each of Electric Vehicle, Mousetrap Vehicle, Gravity Vehicle, and Scrambler respectively.\n[\n17\n]\nStates have substantial leeway in how they run their organization; several states, notably\nNorth Carolina\n[\n18\n]\n[\n19\n]\nand\nTexas\n, run altered slates of events; in the case of Texas, teams can choose to replace National events with state-exclusive events.\n2023–2024 events\n[\nedit\n]\nEvent name\nDivision B events\nDivision C events\nAir Trajectory\nAir Trajectory\nAnatomy and Physiology\nAnatomy and Physiology\nCan't Judge a Powder\nAstronomy\nCodebusters\nChem Lab\nCrime Busters\nCodebusters\nDisease Detectives\nDetector Building\nDynamic Planet\nDisease Detectives\nEcology\nDynamic Planet\nExperimental Design\nEcology\nFast Facts\nFermi Questions\nForestry\nFlight\nFossils\nForensics\nMeteorology\nForestry\nMicrobe Mission\nFossils\nOptics\nGeologic Mapping\nReach for the Stars\nMicrobe Mission\nRoad Scholar\nOptics\nRoller Coaster\nRobot Tour\nTower\nScrambler\nWheeled Vehicle\nTower\nWind Power\nWind Power\nWrite it Do it\nWrite it Do it\n2017–2018 events\n[\nedit\n]\nEvent name\nDivision B events\nDivision C events\nAnatomy and Physiology\nAnatomy and Physiology\nBattery Buggy\nAstronomy\nCrime Busters\nChem Lab\nDisease Detectives\nDisease Detectives\nEcology\nEcology\nExperimental Design\nExperimental Design\nFast Facts\nGame On\nForensics\nMeteorology\nHovercraft\nMicrobe Mission\nMaterials Science\nMission Possible\nMicrobe Mission\nMousetrap Vehicle\nOptics\nMystery Architecture\nRemote Sensing\nOptics\nRocks and Minerals\nPotions and Poisons\nThermodynamics\nRoad Scholar\nTowers\nRocks and Minerals\nWright Stuff\nRoller Coaster\nWrite It Do It\nSolar System\n—\nN/a\nThermodynamics\n—\nN/a\nTowers\n—\nN/a\nWrite It Do It\n—\nN/a\n2015–2016 events\n[\nedit\n]\nEvent name\nDivision B events\nDivision C events\nAir Trajectory\nAir Trajectory\nAnatomy and Physiology\nAnatomy and Physiology\nBio-Process Lab\nAstronomy\nBottle Rocket\nBridge Building\nCan't Judge a Powder\nCell Biology\nCrave the Wave\nChem Lab\nCrime Busters\nDisease Detectives\nDisease Detectives\nDynamic Planet\nDynamic Planet\nElectric Vehicle\nElastic Launched Gliders\nExperimental Design\nExperimental Design\nForensics\nFood Science\nFossils\nFossils\nGeoLogic Mapping\nGame On\nGreen Generation\nGreen Generation\nHydrogeology\nInvasive Species\nInvasive Species\nMeteorology\nIt's About Time\nMission Possible\nProtein Modeling\nPicture This\nRobot Arm\nReach for the Stars\nWind Power\nRoad Scholar\nWrite It Do It\nScrambler\n—\nN/a\nSolar System\n—\nN/a\nWind Power\n—\nN/a\nWrite It Do It\n—\nN/a\nTrial and pilot events\n[\nedit\n]\nTrial/Pilot events are, at Regional and State tournaments, events that are specific to that state that are being considered as events for the next year. At Regionals and States, these events may count towards the team's score. At Nationals, however, there is a completely different set of Trial/Pilot events, sometimes known as \"alternate events\" because the people entering them do not have to be on the official team. These do not count towards the team's score, but ribbons and medals are usually awarded.\n[\n20\n]\nDistinction between trial and pilot events\n[\nedit\n]\nThe terms \"trial event\" and \"pilot event\" (also called \"exploratory event\") are sometimes interchangeable, both pertaining to an event that is not an official, national event for the year. However, at the National Tournament, there are often two differences. First, in 2010, it was announced that medals would only be awarded to the top 3 in the Trial events, but not at all in the Pilot events. Also, the Trial event are often much closer to becoming official events for following years than pilot events. Almost all of the Trial events from recent National tournaments have become official events within a few years of the tournament, while the same is not true for almost any of the pilot events.\nTeam structure\n[\nedit\n]\nTeams are hosted by the\nschool\nfrom which the participants attend. A team can consist of up to 15\nstudents\nand any number of alternates; some states allow more students per team. At the\nmiddle school\nlevel at nationals, only five ninth graders are allowed to compete on one team; at the\nhigh school\nlevel, only seven twelfth graders are allowed per team. However, state organizations occasionally amend these rules.\n[\n21\n]\nHomeschool\ngroups may also form as many\nteams\nas they need to compete, provided each team consists only of students residing in, at most, two contiguous counties.\n[\n22\n]\nAlthough teams may have an unlimited number of alternates, it is implicitly stated within the rules that competitors present at the event must have completed all of the work on their event. This is specifically aimed at building events. It is illegal for teams to have their alternates as \"builders\" and their formal team members as \"thinkers\". Judges at the event are allowed to ask any question of the machine or contraption in an effort to keep the scenario above from occurring. Nonetheless, competitors, coaches, and entire teams are expected to have integrity and to abide by this rule.\n[\n23\n]\nScoring\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nwinner\nof the competition is determined by each team's overall\nscore\n. Each\nschool\nis ranked in every event based on that event's rules. For each type of event, the ranking differs. Knowledge events are scored by the correct number of answers; the team with the highest score will receive 1st place, the second highest will receive 2nd place, and so on. If two teams are tied, there are usually tiebreaker questions that apply only to those teams that are tied. The non-testing events are scored based on the individual requirements listed in the Science Olympiad rule book, released each year to reflect new events, requirements, and clarifications. Some events, such as the knowledge/testing-based will rank teams by using the highest scores. However others may use the lowest score. The team's overall score is then calculated by adding together the rank of the school in all events (e.g. 1st place receives 1 point, 2nd place 2 points, etc.). The\nteam\nwith the lowest overall score is declared the winner. However, some state competitions choose to score the competition by awarding more points per place (e.g. 13 points for 1st place, 12 points for 2nd place, etc.) and having the team with the most points being declared the winner.\nThere are several ways to break a\ntie (draw)\n:\nOne method for tie-breaking is based on\nmedals\nwhere the team with more first place medals wins. If both teams have the same amount of first places, it moves to second place medals and so on. This is the method that the National Tournament uses.\nBefore a competition, the event organizer decides on several events to be used as\ntie-breakers\n. If two teams get the same score overall, the team that rates highest in that one event will take the lead.\nA third way of tie-breaking is to use a team's score in trial/pilot events. The team with the best combined score in trial events would win the competition when this method is used.\nIn some competitions, there also may questions added into event, labeled as tie-breakers. If needed, these questions can be used as tie breakers, although this type of tie-breaker is generally for only the event and not the overall rank.\nCompetition levels\n[\nedit\n]\nScience Olympiad competitions occur at the\nregional\n,\nstate\nand\nnational\nlevel. Normally, the top few teams advance from the regional level to state competition, the exact number depending on how many regions there are and how many teams compete. For example, in\nOhio\n, the number of teams qualifying for the state tournament from each regional depends solely on the number of teams participating at that regional,\n[\n24\n]\nwhereas in\nNew York\nthe allocation system involved determining whether or not the winning team in a regional tournament had won the previous year (this method has since been discontinued). In most states, the top team advances from the state to the national competition. Some states with a larger number of teams are allotted a second spot at the national competition to represent their larger participation. Currently, 120 teams compete at the national level each year (60 from Division B and 60 from Division C); the number has changed over the years to accommodate growing participation.\nMany states also hold invitational tournaments. These competitions serve as \"practice rounds\" for qualifying tournaments, and are hosted by individual middle schools, high schools and/or colleges.\n[\n25\n]\nInvitationals occur most commonly in January or February,\n[\n26\n]\n[\n27\n]\n[\n28\n]\nalthough there have been some as early as October\n[\n29\n]\n[\n30\n]\nor as late as April.\n[\n31\n]\nTeams can participate in invitationals from multiple states depending on availability. At some invitationals, only a few events are held. However, many invitational tournaments mimic regional and state competitions in their competitive intensity. For example, MIT hosts an invitational tournament each year with around 70 teams from over a dozen states, including 20 or more past national qualifiers.\n[\n32\n]\n[\n33\n]\nOther tournaments, especially in the Midwest, are well known for their quality and competitiveness. In this way, teams can gain extra practice before competing in regional, state, or national tournaments. In 2014,\nYale University\n[\n34\n]\nbecame one of the first institutions of higher education to host a tournament run by Science Olympiad alumni, with several more following over the next few years.\n[\n32\n]\n[\n35\n]\n[\n36\n]\n[\n31\n]\n[\n37\n]\n[\n38\n]\n[\n39\n]\n[\n40\n]\nNational tournament\n[\nedit\n]\nThe National Science Olympiad competition is held in late May at a different university every year. Teams compete at the state competition with the top one or two schools in Division B and Division C each earning a spot at the national competition. Some states are given a second slot, based on the membership within the division. The total number of invited teams in each division is equal to 60 and the national tournament hosts 120 teams.\n[\n41\n]\nIn 2012, at the\nUniversity of Central Florida\n, a team from Japan was invited as a Global Ambassador Team. Although they competed in several events, their scores were not tallied against the state teams.\nThe competition officially begins with opening ceremonies on Friday night that usually include a notable speaker, such as a\nNobel Laureate\n. A traditional Swap Meet follows the opening ceremonies which is an opportunity for teams to meet and greet. They bring state memorabilia to trade with other teams. The most popular items include hats, license plates, T-shirts, and key chains.\nSaturday includes several time blocks. Each block includes a 60-minute section for each study event, plus a 15-minute break time for competitors to get from one event to another.\nThat night, a formal Awards Ceremony is held. It opens with a short speech followed by awarding medals for the top six teams in each event. Points for all the events are added together to determine an overall national team winner. The trial events are not included in this tally. The top ten teams in each division are recognized with trophies and plaques.\nIn some national tournaments, scholarships are awarded to the top teams in each event. For the 2005 and 2010 competitions, held at the\nUniversity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign\n, first-place event winners received full four-year tuition waivers to the university. At the 2006 National Tournament, host\nIndiana University\nawarded $7,000 annual scholarships to those who finished first place in Division C and who attend the university in their freshman year.\nThe George Washington University\noffered Division C gold medalists at its 2008 National Tournament a $20,000 stipend for those who were accepted and attended GWU. In 2012, the\nUniversity of Central Florida\noffered $30,000 scholarships to the university for first place medalists in Division C. Additional awards may also provided by sponsors and industry leaders for specific events. For example, the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nprovided first place medalists in Disease Detectives (Divisions B & C) with a trip for the two competitors and their coach to tour its facility in\nAtlanta, Georgia\n.\nNational locations and champions\n[\nedit\n]\nThis is a list of past national champions and locations.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n42\n]\nDivision B\nDivision C\nYear\nLocation\nSchool\nState\nSchool\nState\n1985\nMichigan State University\nSlauson Intermediate School\nMI\nSeaholm High School\nMI\n1986\nMichigan State University\nSlauson Intermediate School\nMI\nSeaholm High School\nMI\n1987\nOhio State University\nGompers Secondary School\nCA\nIrmo High School\nSC\n1988\nDelaware State University\nIrmo Middle School\nSC\nHaverford High School\nPA\n1989\nUniversity of Colorado, Boulder\nIrmo Middle School\nSC\nIrmo High School\nSC\n1990\nPenn West Clarion\nIrmo Middle School\nSC\nIrmo High School\nSC\n1991\nPenn Valley Community College\nGrandville Junior High School\nMI\nLa Jolla High School\nCA\n1992\nAuburn University\nJenison Junior High School\nMI\nLa Jolla High School\nCA\n1993\nUniversity of Southern Colorado\nThomas Jefferson Middle School\nIN\nGrand Haven High School\nMI\n1994\nUniversity of Arizona\nState College Junior High School\nPA\nGrand Haven High School\nMI\n1995\nIndiana University\nState College Junior High School\nPA\nHarriton High School\nPA\n1996\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nThomas Jefferson Middle School\nIN\nTroy High School\nCA\n1997\nNorth Carolina State University\nJ.C.

It is a broad field utilizing numerous practices such as the analysis of\nDNA\n,\nfingerprints\n,\nbloodstain patterns\n,\nfirearms\n,\nballistics\n,\ntoxicology\n,\nmicroscopy\n, and\nfire debris analysis\n. Modern forensic analysis is also conducted on\ncybersecurity\nrelated incidents where major breach has occurred leading to substantial financial loss.\nForensic scientists collect, preserve, and analyze\nevidence\nduring the course of an investigation. While some forensic scientists travel to the scene of the crime to collect the evidence themselves, others occupy a laboratory role, performing analysis on objects brought to them by other individuals.\n[\n3\n]\nOthers are involved in analysis of financial, banking, or other numerical data for use in financial crime investigation, and can be employed as consultants from private firms, academia, or as government employees.\n[\n4\n]\nIn addition to their laboratory role, forensic scientists testify as\nexpert witnesses\nin both\ncriminal\nand\ncivil\ncases and can work for either the\nprosecution\nor the defense. While any field could technically be\nforensic\n, certain sections have developed over time to encompass the majority of forensically related cases.\n[\n5\n]\nEtymology\n[\nedit\n]\nThe term\nforensic\nstems from the Latin word,\nforēnsis\n(3rd declension, adjective), meaning \"of a forum, place of assembly\".\n[\n6\n]\nThe history of the term originates in Roman times, where many judicial processes, such as trials and preliminary hearings, were held in the forum. This origin is the source of the two modern usages of the word\nforensic\n—as a form of legal evidence; and as a category of public presentation.\n[\n7\n]\nIn modern use, the term\nforensics\nis often used in place of \"forensic science.\"\nThe word \"\nscience\n\", is derived from the Latin word for 'knowledge' and is today closely tied to the\nscientific method\n, a systematic way of acquiring knowledge. Taken together, forensic science means the use of scientific methods and processes for crime solving.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section\nneeds additional citations for\nverification\n.\nPlease help\nimprove this article\nby\nadding citations to reliable sources\nin this section.

Criminal investigations and trials relied heavily on forced\nconfessions\nand witness\ntestimony\n. However, ancient sources do contain several accounts of techniques that foreshadow concepts in forensic science developed centuries later.\n[\n8\n]\nThe first written account of using\nmedicine\nand\nentomology\nto solve criminal cases is attributed to the book of\nXi Yuan Lu\n(translated as\nWashing Away of Wrongs\n[\n9\n]\n[\n10\n]\n), written in China in 1248 by\nSong Ci\n(\n宋慈\n, 1186–1249), a director of justice, jail and supervision,\n[\n11\n]\nduring the\nSong dynasty\n.\nSong Ci introduced regulations concerning autopsy reports to court,\n[\n12\n]\nhow to protect the evidence in the examining process, and explained why forensic workers must demonstrate impartiality to the public.\n[\n13\n]\nHe devised methods for making antiseptic and for promoting the reappearance of hidden injuries to dead bodies and bones (using sunlight and vinegar under a red-oil umbrella);\n[\n14\n]\nfor calculating the time of death (allowing for weather and insect activity);\n[\n15\n]\ndescribed how to wash and examine the dead body to ascertain the reason for death.\n[\n16\n]\nAt that time the book had described methods for distinguishing between suicide and faked suicide.\n[\n17\n]\nHe wrote the book on forensics stating that all wounds or dead bodies should be examined, not avoided. The book became the first form of literature to help determine the cause of death.\n[\n18\n]\nIn one of Song Ci's accounts (\nWashing Away of Wrongs\n), the case of a person murdered with a sickle was solved by an investigator who instructed each suspect to bring his sickle to one location. (He realized it was a sickle by testing various blades on an animal carcass and comparing the wounds.) Flies, attracted by the smell of blood, eventually gathered on a single sickle. In light of this, the owner of that sickle confessed to the murder. The book also described how to distinguish between a\ndrowning\n(water in the\nlungs\n) and\nstrangulation\n(broken neck\ncartilage\n), and described evidence from examining corpses to determine if a death was caused by murder, suicide or accident.\n[\n19\n]\nMethods from around the world involved saliva and examination of the mouth and tongue to determine innocence or guilt, as a precursor to the\nPolygraph test\n. In ancient India,\n[\n20\n]\nsome suspects were made to fill their mouths with dried rice and spit it back out. Similarly, in ancient\nChina\n, those accused of a crime would have rice powder placed in their mouths.\n[\n21\n]\nIn ancient\nmiddle-eastern\ncultures, the accused were made to lick hot metal rods briefly. It is thought that these tests had some validity\n[\n22\n]\nsince a guilty person would produce less saliva and thus have a drier mouth;\n[\n23\n]\nthe accused would be considered guilty if rice was sticking to their mouths in abundance or if their tongues were severely burned due to lack of shielding from saliva.\n[\n24\n]\nEducation and training\n[\nedit\n]\nInitial glance, forensic intelligence may appear as a nascent facet of forensic science facilitated by advancements in information technologies such as computers, databases, and data-flow management software. However, a more profound examination reveals that forensic intelligence represents a genuine and emerging inclination among forensic practitioners to actively participate in investigative and policing strategies. In doing so, it elucidates existing practices within scientific literature, advocating for a paradigm shift from the prevailing conception of forensic science as a conglomerate of disciplines merely aiding the criminal justice system. Instead, it urges a perspective that views forensic science as a discipline studying the informative potential of traces—remnants of criminal activity. Embracing this transformative shift poses a significant challenge for education, necessitating a shift in learners' mindset to accept concepts and methodologies in forensic intelligence.\n[\n25\n]\nRecent calls advocating for the integration of forensic scientists into the criminal justice system, as well as policing and intelligence missions, underscore the necessity for the establishment of educational and training initiatives in the field of forensic intelligence. This article contends that a discernible gap exists between the perceived and actual comprehension of forensic intelligence among law enforcement and forensic science managers, positing that this asymmetry can be rectified only through educational interventions.\n[\n26\n]\nThe primary challenge in forensic intelligence education and training is identified as the formulation of programs aimed at heightening awareness, particularly among managers, to mitigate the risk of making suboptimal decisions in information processing. The paper highlights two recent European courses as exemplars of educational endeavors, elucidating lessons learned and proposing future directions.\nThe overarching conclusion is that the heightened focus on forensic intelligence has the potential to rejuvenate a proactive approach to forensic science, enhance quantifiable efficiency, and foster greater involvement in investigative and managerial decision-making. A novel educational challenge is articulated for forensic science university programs worldwide: a shift in emphasis from a fragmented criminal trace analysis to a more comprehensive security problem-solving approach.\nDevelopment of forensic science\n[\nedit\n]\nAmbroise Paré\n's surgical work laid the groundwork for the development of forensic techniques in the following centuries.\nIn 16th-century Europe, medical practitioners in army and university settings began to gather information on the cause and\nmanner of death\n.\nAmbroise Paré\n, a French army\nsurgeon\n, systematically studied the effects of violent death on internal organs.\n[\n27\n]\n[\n28\n]\nTwo\nItalian\nsurgeons, Fortunato Fidelis and Paolo Zacchia, laid the foundation of modern\npathology\nby studying changes that occurred in the structure of the body as the result of disease.\n[\n29\n]\nIn the late 18th century, writings on these topics began to appear. These included\nA Treatise on Forensic Medicine and Public Health\nby the French physician\nFrançois-Emmanuel Fodéré\n[\n30\n]\nand\nThe Complete System of Police Medicine\nby the German medical expert\nJohann Peter Frank\n.\n[\n31\n]\nAs the rational values of the\nEnlightenment era\nincreasingly permeated society in the 18th century, criminal investigation became a more evidence-based, rational procedure − the use of torture to force confessions was curtailed, and belief in witchcraft and other powers of the\noccult\nlargely ceased to influence the court's decisions. Two examples of English forensic science in individual legal proceedings demonstrate the increasing use of\nlogic\nand procedure in criminal investigations at the time. In 1784, in\nLancaster\n, John Toms was tried and convicted for murdering Edward Culshaw with a\npistol\n. When the dead body of Culshaw was examined, a pistol wad (crushed paper used to secure powder and balls in the muzzle) found in his head wound matched perfectly with a torn newspaper found in Toms's pocket, leading to the\nconviction\n.\n[\n32\n]\nThis is an example and explanation of extractor/ejector marks on casings.\nIn\nWarwick\n1816, a farm laborer was tried and convicted of the murder of a young maidservant. She had been drowned in a shallow pool and bore the marks of violent assault. The police found footprints and an impression from corduroy cloth with a sewn patch in the damp earth near the pool. There were also scattered grains of\nwheat\nand chaff. The breeches of a farm labourer who had been threshing wheat nearby were examined and corresponded exactly to the impression in the earth near the pool.\n[\n33\n]\nAn article appearing in\nScientific American\nin 1885 describes the use of\nmicroscopy\nto distinguish between the blood of two persons in a criminal case in Chicago.\n[\n34\n]\nChromatography\n[\nedit\n]\nChromatography\nis a common technique used in the field of Forensic Science. Chromatography is a method of separating the components of a mixture from a mobile phase.\n[\n35\n]\nChromatography is an essential tool used in forensic science, helping analysts identify and compare trace amounts of samples including ignitable liquids, drugs, and biological samples. Many laboratories utilize\ngas chromatography\n/\nmass spectrometry\n(GC/MS) to examine these kinds of samples; this analysis provides rapid and reliant data to identify samples in question.\n[\n36\n]\nToxicology\n[\nedit\n]\nA method for detecting arsenious oxide, simple\narsenic\n, in corpses was devised in 1773 by the Swedish chemist,\nCarl Wilhelm Scheele\n.\n[\n37\n]\nHis work was expanded upon, in 1806, by German chemist Valentin Ross, who learned to detect the poison in the walls of a victim's stomach.\n[\n38\n]\nToxicology, a subfield of forensic chemistry, focuses on detecting and identifying drugs, poisons, and other toxic substances in biological samples. Forensic toxicologists work on cases involving drug overdoses, poisoning, and substance abuse. Their work is critical in determining whether harmful substances play a role in a person's death or impairment.\nread more\nApparatus for the arsenic test, devised by\nJames Marsh\nJames Marsh\nwas the first to apply this new science to the art of forensics. He was called by the prosecution in a murder trial to give evidence as a chemist in 1832. The defendant, John Bodle, was accused of poisoning his grandfather with arsenic-laced coffee. Marsh performed the standard test by mixing a suspected sample with\nhydrogen sulfide\nand\nhydrochloric acid\n. While he was able to detect arsenic as yellow\narsenic trisulfide\n, when it was shown to the jury it had deteriorated, allowing the suspect to be acquitted due to reasonable doubt.\n[\n39\n]\nAnnoyed by that, Marsh developed a much better test. He combined a sample containing arsenic with\nsulfuric acid\nand arsenic-free\nzinc\n, resulting in\narsine\ngas. The gas was ignited, and it decomposed to pure metallic arsenic, which, when passed to a cold surface, would appear as a silvery-black deposit.\n[\n40\n]\nSo sensitive was the test, known formally as the\nMarsh test\n, that it could detect as little as one-fiftieth of a milligram of arsenic. He first described this test in\nThe Edinburgh Philosophical Journal\nin 1836.\n[\n41\n]\nBallistics and firearms\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nForensic firearm examination\nBallistics is \"the science of the motion of projectiles in flight\".\n[\n42\n]\nIn forensic science, analysts examine the patterns left on bullets and cartridge casings after being ejected from a weapon. When fired, a bullet is left with indentations and markings that are unique to the barrel and firing pin of the firearm that ejected the bullet. This examination can help scientists identify possible makes and models of weapons connected to a crime.\nHenry Goddard at\nScotland Yard\npioneered the use of bullet comparison in 1835. He noticed a flaw in the bullet that killed the victim and was able to trace this back to the mold that was used in the manufacturing process.\n[\n43\n]\nEntry/exit wounds based on the distance the firearm was discharged\nAnthropometry\n[\nedit\n]\nFrontispiece\nfrom\nBertillon's\nIdentification anthropométrique\n(1893), demonstrating the measurements needed for his anthropometric identification system\nThe French police officer\nAlphonse Bertillon\nwas the first to apply the anthropological technique of\nanthropometry\nto law enforcement, thereby creating an identification system based on physical measurements. Before that time, criminals could be identified only by name or photograph.\n[\n44\n]\n[\n45\n]\nDissatisfied with the\nad hoc\nmethods used to identify captured criminals in France in the 1870s, he began his work on developing a reliable system of anthropometrics for human classification.\n[\n46\n]\nBertillon created many other\nforensics\ntechniques, including\nforensic document examination\n, the use of\ngalvanoplastic\ncompounds to preserve\nfootprints\n,\nballistics\n, and the\ndynamometer\n, used to determine the degree of force used in\nbreaking and entering\n. Although his central methods were soon to be supplanted by\nfingerprinting\n, \"his other contributions like the\nmug shot\nand the systematization of crime-scene photography remain in place to this day.\"\n[\n45\n]\nFingerprints\n[\nedit\n]\nSir\nWilliam Herschel\nwas one of the first to advocate the use of fingerprinting in the identification of criminal suspects. While working for the\nIndian Civil Service\n, he began to use thumbprints on documents as a security measure to prevent the then-rampant repudiation of signatures in 1858.\n[\n47\n]\nFingerprints taken by\nWilliam Herschel\n1859/60\nIn 1877 at Hooghly (near Kolkata), Herschel instituted the use of fingerprints on contracts and deeds, and he registered government pensioners' fingerprints to prevent the collection of money by relatives after a pensioner's death.\n[\n48\n]\nIn 1880,\nHenry Faulds\n, a Scottish surgeon in a\nTokyo\nhospital, published his first paper on the subject in the scientific journal\nNature\n, discussing the usefulness of fingerprints for identification and proposing a method to record them with printing ink. He established their first classification and was also the first to identify fingerprints left on a vial.\n[\n49\n]\nReturning to the UK in 1886, he offered the concept to the\nMetropolitan Police\nin London, but it was dismissed at that time.\n[\n50\n]\nFaulds wrote to\nCharles Darwin\nwith a description of his method, but, too old and ill to work on it, Darwin gave the information to his cousin,\nFrancis Galton\n, who was interested in anthropology. Having been thus inspired to study fingerprints for ten years, Galton published a detailed statistical model of fingerprint analysis and identification and encouraged its use in forensic science in his book\nFinger Prints\n. He had calculated that the chance of a \"false positive\" (two different individuals having the same fingerprints) was about 1 in 64 billion.\n[\n51\n]\nWomen clerical employees of the\nLA Police Department\ngetting\nfingerprinted\nand photographed in 1928\nJuan Vucetich\n, an Argentine chief police officer, created the first method of recording the fingerprints of individuals on file. In 1892, after studying Galton's pattern types, Vucetich set up the world's first fingerprint bureau. In that same year, Francisca Rojas of\nNecochea\nwas found in a house with neck injuries whilst her two sons were found dead with their throats cut. Rojas accused a neighbour, but despite brutal interrogation, this neighbour would not confess to the crimes. Inspector Alvarez, a colleague of Vucetich, went to the scene and found a bloody thumb mark on a door. When it was compared with Rojas' prints, it was found to be identical with her right thumb. She then confessed to the murder of her sons.\nA Fingerprint Bureau was established in Calcutta (\nKolkata\n), India, in 1897, after the Council of the Governor General approved a committee report that fingerprints should be used for the classification of criminal records. Working in the Calcutta Anthropometric Bureau, before it became the Fingerprint Bureau, were\nAzizul Haque\nand\nHem Chandra Bose\n. Haque and Bose were Indian fingerprint experts who have been credited with the primary development of a fingerprint classification system eventually named after their supervisor,\nSir Edward Richard Henry\n.\n[\n52\n]\n[\n53\n]\nThe\nHenry Classification System\n, co-devised by Haque and Bose, was accepted in England and Wales when the first United Kingdom Fingerprint Bureau was founded in\nScotland Yard\n, the\nMetropolitan Police\nheadquarters, London, in 1901. Sir Edward Richard Henry subsequently achieved improvements in dactyloscopy.\n[\n54\n]\nIn the United States, Henry P. DeForrest used fingerprinting in the\nNew York Civil Service\nin 1902, and by December 1905,\nNew York City Police Department\nDeputy Commissioner Joseph A. Faurot, an expert in the\nBertillon\nsystem and a fingerprint advocate at Police Headquarters, introduced the fingerprinting of criminals to the United States.\n[\n55\n]\nUhlenhuth test\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nUhlenhuth test\n, or the antigen–antibody\nprecipitin\ntest for species, was invented by\nPaul Uhlenhuth\nin 1901 and could distinguish human\nblood\nfrom animal blood, based on the discovery that the blood of different species had one or more characteristic proteins. The test represented a major breakthrough and came to have tremendous importance in forensic science.\n[\n56\n]\nThe test was further refined for forensic use by the Swiss chemist Maurice Müller in the  year 1960s.\n[\n57\n]\nDNA\n[\nedit\n]\nForensic\nDNA analysis\nwas first used in 1984. It was developed by Sir\nAlec Jeffreys\n, who realized that variation in the genetic sequence could be used to identify individuals and to tell individuals apart from one another. The first application of DNA profiles was used by Jeffreys in a double murder mystery in the small English town of\nNarborough, Leicestershire\n, in 1985. A 15-year-old school girl by the name of Lynda Mann was raped and murdered in Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital. The police did not find a suspect but were able to obtain a semen sample.\nIn 1986, Dawn Ashworth, 15 years old, was also raped and strangled in the nearby village of\nEnderby\n. Forensic evidence showed that both killers had the same blood type. Richard Buckland became the suspect because he worked at Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital, had been spotted near Dawn Ashworth's murder scene and knew unreleased details about the body. He later confessed to Dawn's murder but not Lynda's.  Jefferys was brought into the case to analyze the semen samples. He concluded that there was no match between the samples and Buckland, who became the first person to be exonerated using DNA. Jefferys confirmed that the DNA profiles were identical for the two murder semen samples. To find the perpetrator, DNA samples from the entire male population, more than 4,000 aged from 17 to 34, of the town were collected. They all were compared to semen samples from the crime.  A friend of\nColin Pitchfork\nwas heard saying that he had given his sample to the police claiming to be Colin. Colin Pitchfork was arrested in 1987 and it was found that his DNA profile matched the semen samples from the murder.\nBecause of this case, DNA databases were developed. There is the national (FBI) and international databases as well as the European countries (ENFSI: European Network of Forensic Science Institutes). These searchable databases are used to match crime scene DNA profiles to those already in a database.\n[\n58\n]\nMaturation\n[\nedit\n]\nPolice brought to bear the latest techniques of forensic science in their attempts to identify and capture the serial killer\nJack the Ripper\n.\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the science of forensics had become largely established in the sphere of criminal investigation. Scientific and surgical investigation was widely employed by the\nMetropolitan Police\nduring their pursuit of the mysterious\nJack the Ripper\n, who had killed a number of women in the 1880s. This case is a watershed in the application of forensic science. Large teams of policemen conducted house-to-house inquiries throughout Whitechapel. Forensic material was collected and examined. Suspects were identified, traced and either examined more closely or eliminated from the inquiry. Police work follows the same pattern today.\n[\n59\n]\nOver 2000 people were interviewed, \"upwards of 300\" people were investigated, and 80 people were detained.\n[\n60\n]\nThe investigation was initially conducted by the\nCriminal Investigation Department\n(CID), headed by Detective Inspector\nEdmund Reid\n. Later, Detective Inspectors\nFrederick Abberline\n,\nHenry Moore\n, and\nWalter Andrews\nwere sent from Central Office at\nScotland Yard\nto assist. Initially, butchers, surgeons and physicians were suspected because of the manner of the mutilations. The alibis of local butchers and slaughterers were investigated, with the result that they were eliminated from the inquiry.\n[\n61\n]\nSome contemporary figures thought the pattern of the murders indicated that the culprit was a butcher or cattle drover on one of the cattle boats that plied between London and mainland Europe. Whitechapel was close to the\nLondon Docks\n,\n[\n62\n]\nand usually such boats docked on Thursday or Friday and departed on Saturday or Sunday.\n[\n63\n]\nThe cattle boats were examined, but the dates of the murders did not coincide with a single boat's movements, and the transfer of a crewman between boats was also ruled out.\n[\n64\n]\nAt the end of October, Robert Anderson asked police surgeon\nThomas Bond\nto give his opinion on the extent of the murderer's surgical skill and knowledge.\n[\n65\n]\nThe opinion offered by Bond on the character of the \"Whitechapel murderer\" is the earliest surviving\noffender profile\n.\n[\n66\n]\nBond's assessment was based on his own examination of the most extensively mutilated victim and the\npost mortem\nnotes from the four previous canonical murders.\n[\n67\n]\nIn his opinion the killer must have been a man of solitary habits, subject to \"periodical attacks of homicidal and erotic\nmania\n\", with the character of the mutilations possibly indicating \"\nsatyriasis\n\".\n[\n67\n]\nBond also stated that \"the homicidal impulse may have developed from a revengeful or brooding condition of the mind, or that religious mania may have been the original disease but I do not think either hypothesis is likely\".\n[\n67\n]\nThe popular fictional character\nSherlock Holmes\nwas in many ways ahead of his time in his use of forensic analysis.\nHandbook for Coroners, police officials, military policemen\nwas written by the\nAustrian\ncriminal jurist\nHans Gross\nin 1893, and is generally acknowledged as the birth of the field of criminalistics. The work combined in one system fields of knowledge that had not been previously integrated, such as psychology and physical science, and which could be successfully used against crime. Gross adapted some fields to the needs of criminal investigation, such as\ncrime scene photography\n. He went on to found the Institute of Criminalistics in 1912, as part of the University of Graz' Law School. This Institute was followed by many similar institutes all over the world.\n[\n68\n]\nIn 1909,\nArchibald Reiss\nfounded the\nInstitut de police scientifique\nof the\nUniversity of Lausanne (UNIL)\n, the first school of forensic science in the world. Dr.\nEdmond Locard\n, became known as the \"\nSherlock Holmes\nof\nFrance\n\". He formulated the basic principle of forensic science: \"Every contact leaves a trace\", which became known as\nLocard's exchange principle\n. In 1910, he founded what may have been the first criminal laboratory in the world, after persuading the Police Department of\nLyon\n(France) to give him two attic rooms and two assistants.\n[\n69\n]\nSymbolic of the newfound prestige of forensics and the use of reasoning in detective work was the popularity of the fictional character\nSherlock Holmes\n, written by\nArthur Conan Doyle\nin the late 19th century. He remains a great inspiration for forensic science, especially for the way his acute study of a crime scene yielded small\nclues\nas to the precise sequence of events. He made great use of\ntrace evidence\nsuch as shoe and tire impressions, as well as fingerprints,\nballistics\nand\nhandwriting analysis\n, now known as\nquestioned document examination\n.\n[\n70\n]\nSuch evidence is used to test theories conceived by the police, for example, or by the investigator himself.\n[\n71\n]\nAll of the techniques advocated by Holmes later became reality, but were generally in their infancy at the time Conan Doyle was writing. In many of his reported cases, Holmes frequently complains of the way the crime scene has been contaminated by others, especially by the police, emphasising the critical importance of maintaining its integrity, a now well-known feature of crime scene examination. He used\nanalytical chemistry\nfor\nblood residue\nanalysis as well as\ntoxicology\nexamination and determination for poisons. He used\nballistics\nby measuring bullet\ncalibres\nand matching them with a suspected murder weapon.\n[\n72\n]\nLate 19th – early 20th century figures\n[\nedit\n]\nShoeprints have long been used to match a pair of shoes to a crime scene.\nHans Gross\napplied scientific methods to crime scenes and was responsible for the birth of criminalistics.\nEdmond Locard\nexpanded on Gross' work with\nLocard's exchange principle\nwhich stated \"whenever two objects come into contact with one another, materials are exchanged between them\". This means that every contact by a criminal leaves a trace.\nAlexandre Lacassagne\n, who taught Locard, produced autopsy standards on actual forensic cases.\nAlphonse Bertillon\nwas a French criminologist and founder of\nAnthropometry\n(scientific study of measurements and proportions of the human body). He used anthropometry for identification, stating that, since each individual is unique, by measuring aspects of physical difference there could be a personal identification system. He created the Bertillon System around 1879, a way of identifying criminals and citizens by measuring 20 parts of the body. In 1884, over 240 repeat offenders were caught using the Bertillon system, but the system was largely superseded by fingerprinting.\nJoseph Thomas Walker\n, known for his work at\nMassachusetts State Police\nChemical Laboratory, for developing many modern forensic techniques which he frequently published in academic journals, and for teaching at the Department of Legal Medicine,\nHarvard University\n.\nFrances Glessner Lee\n, known as \"the mother of forensic science\",\n[\n73\n]\nwas instrumental in the development of forensic science in the US. She lobbied to have coroners replaced by medical professionals, endowed the Harvard Associates in Police Science, and conducted many seminars to educate homicide investigators. She also created the\nNutshell Studies of Unexplained Death\n, intricate crime scene dioramas used to train investigators, which are still in use today.\nMary Louisa Willard\n, a chemistry professor at\nPennsylvania State University\n(Penn State) from the 1920s through early 1960s, used her expertise in\nmicroscopy\nand chemical forensics to assist local and international criminal investigations.\n20th century\n[\nedit\n]\nAlec Jeffreys\ninvented the\nDNA profiling\ntechnique in 1984.\nLater in the 20th century several British pathologists,\nMikey Rochman\n,\nFrancis Camps\n,\nSydney Smith\nand\nKeith Simpson\npioneered new forensic science methods.\nAlec Jeffreys\npioneered the use of\nDNA profiling\nin forensic science in 1984. He realized the scope of DNA fingerprinting, which uses variations in the\ngenetic code\nto identify individuals. The method has since become important in forensic science to assist police detective work, and it has also proved useful in resolving paternity and immigration disputes.\n[\n74\n]\nDNA fingerprinting was first used as a police forensic test to identify the rapist and killer of two teenagers, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, who were both murdered in\nNarborough, Leicestershire\n, in 1983 and 1986 respectively.\nColin Pitchfork\nwas identified and convicted of murder after samples taken from him matched\nsemen\nsamples taken from the two dead girls.\nForensic science has been fostered by a number of national and international forensic science learned bodies including the\nAmerican Academy of Forensic Sciences\n(founded 1948), publishers of the\nJournal of Forensic Sciences\n;\n[\n75\n]\nthe\nCanadian Society of Forensic Science\n(founded 1953), publishers of the\nJournal of the Canadian Society of Forensic Science\n;\nthe Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences\n,\n[\n76\n]\n(founded 1959), then known as the Forensic Science Society, publisher of\nScience & Justice\n;\n[\n77\n]\nthe British Academy of Forensic Sciences\n[\n78\n]\n(founded 1960), publishers of\nMedicine, Science and the Law\n;\n[\n79\n]\nthe\nAustralian Academy of Forensic Sciences\n(founded 1967), publishers of the\nAustralian Journal of Forensic Sciences\n; and the\nEuropean Network of Forensic Science Institutes\n(founded 1995).\n21st century\n[\nedit\n]\nIn the past decade, documenting forensics scenes has become more efficient. Forensic scientists have started using laser scanners, drones and photogrammetry to obtain 3D point clouds of accidents or crime scenes.\n[\n80\n]\nReconstruction of an accident scene on a highway using drones involves data acquisition time of only 10–20 minutes and can be performed without shutting down traffic. The results are not just accurate, in centimeters, for measurement to be presented in court but also easy to digitally preserve in the long term.\n[\n81\n]\nNow, in the 21st century, much of forensic science's future is up for discussion. The\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology\n(NIST) has several forensic science-related programs:\nCSAFE\n, a NIST Center of Excellence in Forensic Science, the\nNational Commission on Forensic Science\n(now concluded), and administration of the Organization of Scientific Area Committees for Forensic Science (OSAC).\n[\n82\n]\nOne of the more recent additions by NIST is a document called NISTIR-7941, titled \"Forensic Science Laboratories: Handbook for Facility Planning, Design, Construction, and Relocation\". The handbook provides a clear blueprint for approaching forensic science. The details even include what type of staff should be hired for certain positions.\n[\n83\n]\nSubdivisions\n[\nedit\n]\nAgents of the\nUnited States Army Criminal Investigation Division\ninvestigate a crime scene.\nPolice forensic investigation in\nAshton-under-Lyne\n, England, using a tent to protect the crime scene\nArt forensics\nconcerns the art authentication cases to help research the work's authenticity.

It is also used to look into and detect the cases concerning gerrymandering.\nForensic accounting\nis the study and interpretation of accounting evidence, financial statement namely: Balance sheet, Income statement, Cash flow statement.\nForensic aerial photography is the study and interpretation of aerial photographic evidence.\nForensic anthropology\nis the application of\nphysical anthropology\nin a legal setting, usually for the\nrecovery and identification\nof\nskeletonized\nhuman remains.\nForensic archaeology\nis the application of a combination of\narchaeological\ntechniques and forensic science, typically in law enforcement.\nForensic astronomy\nuses methods from\nastronomy\nto determine past celestial constellations for forensic purposes.\nForensic botany\nis the study of plant life in order to gain information regarding possible crimes.\nForensic chemistry\nis the study of detection and identification of\nillicit drugs\n, accelerants used in\narson\ncases, explosive and\ngunshot residue\n.\nForensic dactyloscopy\nis the study of\nfingerprints\n.\nForensic document examination or\nquestioned document examination\nanswers questions about a disputed document using a variety of scientific processes and methods. Many examinations involve a comparison of the questioned document, or components of the document, with a set of known standards. The most common type of examination involves handwriting, whereby the examiner tries to address concerns about potential authorship.\nForensic DNA analysis\ntakes advantage of the uniqueness of an individual's DNA to answer forensic questions such as\npaternity/maternity testing\nand placing a suspect at a crime scene, e.g. in a\nrape investigation\n.\nForensic engineering\nis the scientific examination and analysis of structures and products relating to their failure or cause of damage.\nForensic entomology\ndeals with the examination of\ninsects\nin, on and around human remains to assist in determination of time or location of death.

Practitioners of forensic social work connected with the\ncriminal justice system\nare often termed Social Supervisors, whilst the remaining use the interchangeable titles\nforensic social worker\n,\napproved mental health professional\nor forensic practitioner and they conduct specialist assessments of risk, care planning and act as an officer of the court.\nForensic toxicology\nis the study of the effect of\ndrugs\nand\npoisons\non/in the human body.\nForensic video analysis\nis the scientific examination, comparison and evaluation of video in legal matters.\nMobile device forensics\nis the scientific examination and evaluation of evidence found in mobile phones, e.g. Call History and Deleted SMS, and includes SIM Card Forensics.\nTrace evidence\nanalysis is the analysis and comparison of trace evidence including glass, paint, fibres and hair (e.g., using\nmicro-spectrophotometry\n).\nWildlife forensic science\napplies a range of scientific disciplines to legal cases involving non-human biological evidence, to solve crimes such as poaching,\nanimal abuse\n, and trade in endangered species.\nQuestionable techniques\n[\nedit\n]\nSome forensic techniques, believed to be scientifically sound at the time they were used, have turned out later to have much less scientific merit or none.\n[\n91\n]\nSome such techniques include:\nComparative bullet-lead analysis\nwas used by the FBI for over four decades, starting with the\nJohn F. Kennedy assassination\nin 1963.  The theory was that each batch of\nammunition\npossessed a chemical makeup so distinct that a bullet could be traced back to a particular batch or even a specific box.  Internal studies and an outside study by the\nNational Academy of Sciences\nfound that the technique was unreliable due to improper interpretation, and the FBI abandoned the test in 2005.\n[\n92\n]\nForensic dentistry\nhas come under fire:  in at least three cases bite-mark evidence has been used to convict people of murder who were later freed by DNA evidence.\n[\n93\n]\nA 1999 study by a member of the American Board of Forensic Odontology found a 63 percent rate of false identifications and is commonly referenced within online news stories and conspiracy websites.\n[\n94\n]\n[\n95\n]\nThe study was based on an informal workshop during an ABFO meeting, which many members did not consider a valid scientific setting.\n[\n96\n]\nThe theory is that each person has a unique and distinctive set of teeth, which leave a pattern after biting someone. They analyze the dental characteristics such as size, shape, and arch form.\n[\n97\n]\nPolice Access to Genetic Genealogy Databases: There are privacy concerns with the police being able to access personal genetic data that is on genealogy services.\n[\n98\n]\nIndividuals can become criminal informants to their own families or to themselves simply by participating in genetic genealogy databases. The Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) is a database that the FBI uses to hold genetic profiles of all known felons, misdemeanants, and arrestees.\n[\n98\n]\nSome people argue that individuals who are using genealogy databases should have an expectation of privacy in their data that is or may be violated by genetic searches by law enforcement.\n[\n98\n]\nThese different services have warning signs about potential third parties using their information, but most individuals do not read the agreement thoroughly. According to a study by Christi Guerrini, Jill Robinson, Devan Petersen, and Amy McGuire, they found that the majority of the people who took the survey support police searches of genetic websites that identify genetic relatives.\n[\n98\n]\nPeople who responded to the survey are more supportive of police activities using genetic genealogy when it is for the purpose of identifying offenders of violent crimes, suspects of crimes against children or missing people. The data from the surveys that were given show that individuals are not concerned about police searches using personal genetic data if it is justified. It was found in this study that offenders are disproportionally low-income and black and the average person of\ngenetic testing\nis wealthy and white. The results from the study had different results.\n[\n98\n]\nIn 2016, there was a survey called the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) that was provided by the US Bureau of Justice Statistics. In that survey, it was found that 1.3% of people aged 12 or older were victims of violent crimes, and 8.85 of households were victims of property crimes.\n[\n98\n]\nThere were some issues with this survey though. The NCVS produces only the annual estimates of victimization. The survey that Christi Guerrini, Jill Robinson, Devan Petersen, and Amy McGuire produced asked the participants about the incidents of victimization over one's lifetime.\n[\n98\n]\nTheir survey also did not restrict other family members to one household.\n[\n98\n]\nAround 25% of people who responded to the survey said that they have had family members that have been employed by law enforcement which includes security guards and bailiffs.\n[\n98\n]\nThroughout these surveys, it has been found that there is public support for law enforcement to access genetic genealogy databases.\nLitigation science\n[\nedit\n]\n\"Litigation science\" describes analysis or data developed or produced\nexpressly\nfor use in a trial versus those produced in the course of independent research. This distinction was made by the\nU.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\nwhen evaluating the admissibility of experts.\n[\n99\n]\nThis uses\ndemonstrative evidence\n, which is evidence created in preparation of trial by\nattorneys\nor\nparalegals\n.\nDemographics\n[\nedit\n]\nAs of 2025, there are currently an estimated 18,500 forensic science technicians in the United States.\n[\n100\n]\nMedia impact\n[\nedit\n]\nReal-life crime scene investigators and forensic scientists warn that popular television shows do not give a realistic picture of the work, often wildly distorting its nature, and exaggerating the ease, speed, effectiveness, drama, glamour, influence and comfort level of their jobs—which they describe as far more mundane, tedious and boring.\n[\n101\n]\n[\n102\n]\nSome claim these modern TV shows have changed individuals' expectations of forensic science, sometimes unrealistically—an influence termed the \"\nCSI effect\n\".\n[\n103\n]\n[\n104\n]\nFurther, research has suggested that public misperceptions about criminal forensics can create, in the mind of a\njuror\n, unrealistic expectations of forensic evidence—which they expect to see before convicting—implicitly biasing the juror towards the defendant. Citing the \"CSI effect,\" at least one researcher has suggested screening jurors for their level of influence from such TV programs.\n[\n104\n]\nFurther,\nresearch\nhas shown that\nnewspaper\nmedia has been found to shape readers general knowledge and perceptions of science and technology in a rather positive way. It could lead to support of it due to the interest readers may obtain and seek further knowledge on the topic.\nControversies\n[\nedit\n]\nQuestions about certain areas of forensic science, such as fingerprint evidence and the assumptions behind these disciplines have been brought to light in some publications\n[\n105\n]\n[\n106\n]\nincluding the\nNew York Post\n.\n[\n107\n]\nThe article stated that \"No one has proved even the basic assumption: That everyone's fingerprint is unique.\"\n[\n107\n]\nThe article also stated that \"Now such assumptions are being questioned—and with it may come a radical change in how forensic science is used by police departments and prosecutors.\"\n[\n107\n]\nLaw professor Jessica Gabel said on NOVA that forensic science \"lacks the rigors, the standards, the quality controls and procedures that we find, usually, in science\".\n[\n108\n]\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology has reviewed the scientific foundations of bite-mark analysis used in forensic science. Bite mark analysis is a forensic science technique that analyzes the marks on the victim's skin compared to the suspects teeth.\n[\n109\n]\nNIST reviewed the findings of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2009 study. The National Academics of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conducted research to address the issues of reliability, accuracy, and reliability of bitemark analysis, where they concluded that there is a lack of sufficient scientific foundation to support the data.\n[\n110\n]\nYet the technique is still legal to use in court as evidence. NIST funded a 2019 meeting that consisted of dentists, lawyers, researchers and others to address the gaps in this field.\n[\n110\n]\nIn the US, on 25 June 2009, the Supreme Court issued a 5-to-4 decision in\nMelendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts\nstating that crime laboratory reports may not be used against criminal defendants at trial unless the analysts responsible for creating them give testimony and subject themselves to cross-examination.\n[\n111\n]\nThe Supreme Court cited the National Academies of Sciences report\nStrengthening Forensic Science in the United States\n[\n112\n]\nin their decision. Writing for the majority, Justice\nAntonin Scalia\nreferred to the\nNational Research Council\nreport in his assertion that \"Forensic evidence is not uniquely immune from the risk of manipulation.\"\nIn the US, another area of forensic science that has come under question in recent years is the lack of laws requiring the accreditation of forensic labs.  Some states require accreditation, but some states do not.  Because of this,\n[\n113\n]\n[\n114\n]\nmany labs have been caught performing very poor work resulting in false convictions or acquittals.  For example, it was discovered after an audit of the Houston Police Department in 2002 that the lab had fabricated evidence which led George Rodriguez being convicted of raping a fourteen-year-old girl.\n[\n115\n]\nThe former director of the lab, when asked, said that the total number of cases that could have been contaminated by improper work could be in the range of 5,000 to 10,000.\n[\n115\n]\nThe Innocence Project\n[\n116\n]\ndatabase of DNA exonerations shows that many wrongful convictions contained forensic science errors. According to the Innocence project and the US Department of Justice, forensic science has contributed to about 39 percent to 46 percent of wrongful convictions.\n[\n117\n]\nAs indicated by the National Academy of Sciences report\nStrengthening Forensic Sciences in the United States\n,\n[\n112\n]\npart of the problem is that many traditional forensic sciences have never been empirically validated; and part of the problem is that all examiners are subject to forensic confirmation biases and should be shielded from contextual information not relevant to the judgment they make.\nMany studies have discovered a difference in rape-related injuries reporting based on race, with white victims reporting a higher frequency of injuries than black victims.\n[\n118\n]\nHowever, since current forensic examination techniques may not be sensitive to all injuries across a range of skin colors, more research needs to be conducted to understand if this trend is due to skin confounding healthcare providers when examining injuries or if darker skin extends a protective element.\n[\n118\n]\nIn clinical practice, for patients with darker skin, one study recommends that attention must be paid to the thighs, labia majora, posterior fourchette and\nfossa navicularis\n, so that no rape-related injuries are missed upon close examination.\n[\n118\n]\nForensic science and humanitarian work\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross\n(ICRC) uses forensic science for humanitarian purposes to clarify the fate of missing persons after armed conflict, disasters or migration,\n[\n119\n]\nand is one of the services related to\nRestoring Family Links\nand Missing Persons. Knowing what has happened to a missing relative can often make it easier to proceed with the grieving process and move on with life for families of missing persons.\nForensic science is used by various other organizations to clarify the fate and whereabouts of persons who have gone missing. Examples include the NGO\nArgentine Forensic Anthropology Team\n, working to clarify the fate of people who disappeared during the period of the 1976–1983 military dictatorship. The\nInternational Commission on Missing Persons\n(ICMP) used forensic science to find missing persons,\n[\n120\n]\nfor example after the conflicts in the Balkans.\n[\n121\n]\nRecognising the role of forensic science for humanitarian purposes, as well as the importance of forensic investigations in fulfilling the state's responsibilities to investigate human rights violations, a group of experts in the late-1980s devised a UN Manual on the Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, which became known as the\nMinnesota Protocol\n. This document was revised and re-published by the\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights\nin 2016.\n[\n122\n]\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nLaw portal\nScience portal\nAssociation of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners\n– International non-profit organization\nCanadian Identification Society\nComputer forensics\n– Branch of digital forensic science\nCrime science\n– Study of ways to prevent or reduce crime\nDiplomatics\n– Academic study of the protocols of documents (forensic paleography)\nEpigenetics in forensic science\n– Overview article\nEvidence packaging\n– Specialized packaging for physical evidence\nForensic biology\n– Forensic application of the study of biology\nForensic economics\nForensic identification\n– Legal identification of specific objects and materials\nForensic materials engineering\n– Branch of forensic engineering\nForensic photography\n– Art of producing an accurate reproduction of a crime scene\nForensic polymer engineering\n– Study of failure in polymeric products\nForensic profiling\n– Study of trace evidence in criminal investigations\nGlove prints\n– Mark left on a surface by a worn glove\nHistory of forensic photography\nInternational Association for Identification\nMarine forensics\nOutline of forensic science\n– Overview of and topical guide to forensic science\nProfiling (information science)\n– Creation and use of user profiles via data analysis\nRetrospective diagnosis\n– Practice of identifying an illness after the death of the patient\nRapid Stain Identification Series\n(RSID)\nScenes of crime officer\n– Officer who gathers forensic evidence for the British police\nSkid mark\n– Mark left by any solid which moves against another\nUniversity of Florida forensic science distance education program\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\n\"Criminalistics\"\n.\nEncyclopedia.com\n.

It uses\nmathematics\n,\nphysics\n, and\nchemistry\nto explain their origin and their overall\nevolution\n. Objects of interest include\nplanets\n,\nmoons\n,\nstars\n,\nnebulae\n,\ngalaxies\n,\nmeteoroids\n,\nasteroids\n, and\ncomets\n. Relevant phenomena include\nsupernova\nexplosions,\ngamma ray bursts\n,\nquasars\n,\nblazars\n,\npulsars\n, and\ncosmic microwave background radiation\n. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates beyond\nEarth's atmosphere\n.\nCosmology\nis the branch of astronomy that studies the\nuniverse\nas a whole.\nAstronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in\nrecorded history\nmade methodical observations of the\nnight sky\n. These include the\nEgyptians\n,\nBabylonians\n,\nGreeks\n,\nIndians\n,\nChinese\n,\nMaya\n, and many ancient\nindigenous peoples of the Americas\n. In the past, astronomy included disciplines as diverse as\nastrometry\n,\ncelestial navigation\n,\nobservational astronomy\n, and the making of\ncalendars\n.\nAstronomy is one of the few sciences in which amateurs play an\nactive role\n. This is especially true for the discovery and observation of\ntransient events\n.\nAmateur astronomers\nhave helped with many important discoveries, such as finding new comets.\nEtymology\nAstronomy\n(from the\nGreek\nἀστρονομία\nfrom\nἄστρον\nastron\n, \"star\" and -νομία\n-nomia\nfrom\nνόμος\nnomos\n, \"law\" or \"rule\") means study of celestial objects.\n[\n1\n]\nAstronomy should not be confused with\nastrology\n, the belief system which claims that human affairs are correlated with the positions of celestial objects. The\ntwo fields\nshare a common origin but became distinct, astronomy being supported by\nphysics\nwhile astrology is not.\n[\n2\n]\nUse of terms \"astronomy\" and \"astrophysics\"\n\"Astronomy\" and \"\nastrophysics\n\" are broadly synonymous in modern usage.\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\nIn dictionary definitions, \"astronomy\" is \"the study of objects and matter outside the Earth's atmosphere and of their physical and chemical properties\",\n[\n6\n]\nwhile \"astrophysics\" is the branch of astronomy dealing with \"the behavior, physical properties, and dynamic processes of celestial objects and phenomena\".\n[\n7\n]\nSometimes, as in the introduction of the introductory textbook\nThe Physical Universe\nby\nFrank Shu\n, \"astronomy\" means the qualitative study of the subject, whereas \"astrophysics\" is the physics-oriented version of the subject.\n[\n8\n]\nSome fields, such as\nastrometry\n, are in this sense purely astronomy rather than also astrophysics. Research departments may use \"astronomy\" and \"astrophysics\" according to whether the department is historically affiliated with a physics department,\n[\n4\n]\nand many professional\nastronomers\nhave physics rather than astronomy degrees.\n[\n5\n]\nThus, in modern use, the two terms are often used interchangeably.\n[\n3\n]\nHistory\nMain article:\nHistory of astronomy\nFor a chronological guide, see\nTimeline of astronomy\n.\nPre-historic\nMegaliths from\nNabta Playa\n, constructed by Neolithic populations,\n[\n9\n]\nlocated in\nAswan\n,\nUpper Egypt\n.\n[\n10\n]\nThe\nNebra sky disc\nfound on\nMittenberg hill\nin Germany and dated to\nc.\n1800–1600 BCE\n.\n[\n11\n]\nThe initial development of astronomy was driven by practical needs like agricultural calendars. Before recorded history archeological sites such as\nStonehenge\nprovide evidence of ancient interest in astronomical observations.\n[\n12\n]\n: 15\nEvidence also comes from artefacts such as the\nNebra sky disc\ninlaid with symbols interpreted as a sun, moon, and stars including\na cluster of seven stars\n.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n14\n]\n[\n15\n]\nMegalithic structures located in\nNabta Playa\n, Upper Egypt featured astronomical calendar arrangements in alignment with the heliacal rising of\nSirius\nand supported calibration the yearly calendar for the annual Nile flood.\n[\n16\n]\nClassical\nA Babylonian\nplanisphere\n(7th century BCE) was an early astronomical instrument. Its use of\nsexagesimals\n(e.g. 12, 24, 60, 360) is still being used today through having been broadly adopted for\ntimekeeping\nand\nastrometry\n.\n[\n17\n]\nCivilizations such as\nEgypt\n,\nMesopotamia\n,\nGreece\n,\nIndia\n,\nChina\nindependently but with cross-cultural influences created astronomical observatories and developed ideas on the nature of the Universe, along with calendars and astronomical instruments.\n[\n18\n]\nA key early development was the beginning of mathematical and scientific astronomy among the Babylonians, laying the foundations for astronomical traditions in other civilizations.\n[\n19\n]\nThe Babylonians discovered that\nlunar eclipses\nrecurred in the\nsaros cycle\nof 223\nsynodic months\n.\n[\n20\n]\nFollowing the Babylonians, significant advances were made in\nancient Greece\nand the\nHellenistic world\n. Greek astronomy sought a rational, physical explanation for celestial phenomena.\n[\n21\n]\nIn the 4th century BC,\nHeracleides Ponticus\nwas the first to proposed that the Earth rotates on its own axis.\n[\n22\n]\nIn the 3rd century BC,\nAristarchus of Samos\nestimated the\nsize and distance of the Moon and Sun\n, and he proposed a model of the\nSolar System\nwhere the Earth and planets rotated around the Sun, now called the\nheliocentric\nmodel.\n[\n23\n]\nIn the 2nd century BC,\nHipparchus\ncalculated the size and distance of the Moon and invented the earliest known astronomical devices such as the\nastrolabe\n.\n[\n24\n]\nHe also observed the small drift in the positions of the equinoxes and solstices with respect to the fixed stars that we now know is caused by\nprecession\n.\n[\n12\n]\nHipparchus also created a catalog of 1020 stars, and most of the\nconstellations\nof the northern hemisphere derive from Greek astronomy.\n[\n25\n]\nThe\nAntikythera mechanism\n(\nc.\n150\n–80 BC) was an early\nanalog computer\ndesigned to calculate the location of the\nSun\n,\nMoon\n, and\nplanets\nfor a given date. Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical\nastronomical clocks\nappeared in Europe.\n[\n26\n]\nPost-classical\nAfter the classical Greek era, astronomy was dominated by the\ngeocentric model\nof the Universe, or the\nPtolemaic system\n, named after\nClaudius Ptolemy\n. His 13-volume astronomy work, named the\nAlmagest\nin its Arabic translation, became the primary reference for over a thousand years.\n[\n27\n]\n: 196\nIn this system, the Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it.\n[\n28\n]\nWhile the system would eventually be discredited, it gave the most accurate predictions for the positions of astronomical bodies available at that time.\n[\n27\n]\nWith the arrival of Hellenistic astronomy in India through trade and cultural contacts, Indian astronomy entered a new phase during the early centuries CE.\n[\n29\n]\nEarlier indigenous traditions, such as those recorded in the Vedāṅga Jyotiṣa, provided calendrical foundations, while Greek astronomical models were later integrated by scholars including\nĀryabhaṭa\n,\nVarāhamihira\n, and Brahmagupta.\n[\n30\n]\nĀryabhaṭa notably improved methods for calculating planetary motions and eclipses.\n[\n31\n]\nIn the later medieval period, the\nKerala school\ncontributed to astronomy through refined observational practices and more accurate planetary and eclipse calculations.\n[\n32\n]\nPortrait of\nAlfraganus\nin the\nCompilatio astronomica\n, 1493.\nIslamic astronomers\ncollected and translated\nIndian\n,\nPersian\nand\nGreek\ntexts, adding their own work.\n[\n33\n]\nAstronomy flourished in the medieval Islamic world\n. Astronomical\nobservatories\nwere established there by the early 9th century.\n[\n34\n]\n[\n35\n]\n[\n36\n]\nIn 964, the\nAndromeda Galaxy\n, the largest\ngalaxy\nin the\nLocal Group\n, was described by the Persian Muslim astronomer\nAbd al-Rahman al-Sufi\nin his\nBook of Fixed Stars\n.\n[\n37\n]\nThe\nSN 1006\nsupernova\n, the brightest\napparent magnitude\nstellar event in the last 1000 years, was observed by the Egyptian Arabic astronomer\nAli ibn Ridwan\nand\nChinese astronomers\nin 1006.\n[\n38\n]\nIranian scholar\nAl-Biruni\nobserved that, contrary to\nPtolemy\n, the Sun's\napogee\n(highest point in the heavens) was mobile, not fixed.\n[\n39\n]\n[\n40\n]\nArabic astronomers introduced many\nArabic names now used for individual stars\n.\n[\n41\n]\nThe ruins at\nGreat Zimbabwe\nand\nTimbuktu\n[\n42\n]\nmay have housed astronomical observatories.\n[\n43\n]\nIn Post-classical West Africa, astronomers studied the movement of stars and relation to seasons, crafting charts of the heavens and diagrams of orbits of the other planets based on complex mathematical calculations.\n[\n44\n]\nSonghai\nhistorian\nMahmud Kati\ndocumented a\nmeteor shower\nin 1583.\n[\n45\n]\nIn medieval Europe,\nRichard of Wallingford\n(1292–1336) invented the first astronomical clock, the\nRectangulus\nwhich allowed for the measurement of angles between planets and other astronomical bodies,\n[\n46\n]\nas well as an\nequatorium\ncalled the\nAlbion\nwhich could be used for astronomical calculations such as\nlunar\n,\nsolar\nand\nplanetary\nlongitudes\n.\n[\n47\n]\nNicole Oresme\n(1320–1382) discussed evidence for the rotation of the Earth.\n[\n48\n]\nJean Buridan\n(1300–1361) developed the\ntheory of impetus\n, describing motions including of the celestial bodies.\n[\n49\n]\n[\n50\n]\nFor over six centuries (from the recovery of ancient learning during the late Middle Ages into the Enlightenment), the\nRoman Catholic Church\ngave more financial and social support to the study of astronomy than probably all other institutions. Among the Church's motives was finding the\ndate for Easter\n.\n[\n51\n]\nCopernicus\nDuring the\nRenaissance\n,\nNicolaus Copernicus\nproposed a heliocentric model of the solar system.\n[\n52\n]\nWhile his model maintained circular orbits, it was sufficient to calculate the size of planetary orbits and their period. The appealing simplicity of Copernican astronomy led to its adoption among astronomers even before it was confirmed by Galileo's telescopic observations in the 1600s.\n[\n12\n]\n: 40\nEarly telescopic\nThe first sketches of the Moon's topography, from\nGalileo\n's ground-breaking\nSidereus Nuncius\n(1610)\nSometime around 1608 the telescope was invented and by 1610,\nGalileo Galilei\nobserved phases on the planet\nVenus\nsimilar to those of the Moon, supporting the heliocentric model.\n[\n12\n]\nAround the same time the heliocentric model was organized quantitatively by\nJohannes Kepler\n.\n[\n53\n]\nAnalyzing two decades of careful observations by\nTycho Brahe\n, Kepler devised a system that described the details of the motion of the planets around the Sun.\n[\n54\n]\n: 4\n[\n55\n]\nWhile Kepler discarded the uniform circular motion of Copernicus in favor of elliptical motion,\n[\n12\n]\nhe did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down.\n[\n56\n]\nIt was\nIsaac Newton\n, with his invention of\ncelestial dynamics\nand his\nlaw of gravitation\n, who finally explained the motions of the planets.\n[\n57\n]\nNewton also developed the\nreflecting telescope\n.\n[\n58\n]\nNewton, in collaboration with\nRichard Bentley\nproposed that stars are like the Sun only much further away.\n[\n54\n]\nThe new telescopes also altered ideas about stars. By 1610 Galileo discovered that the band of light crossing the sky at night that we call the\nMilky Way\nwas composed of numerous stars.\n[\n12\n]\n: 48\nIn 1668\nJames Gregory\ncompared the luminosity of Jupiter to\nSirius\nto estimate its distance at over 83,000 AU.\n[\n54\n]\nThe English astronomer\nJohn Flamsteed\n, Britain's first\nAstronomer Royal\n, catalogued over 3000 stars but the data were published against his wishes in 1712.\n[\n59\n]\nThe astronomer\nWilliam Herschel\nmade a detailed catalog of nebulosity and clusters, and in 1781 discovered the planet\nUranus\n, the first new planet found.\n[\n60\n]\nFriedrich Bessel\ndeveloped the technique of\nstellar parallax\nin 1838 but it was so difficult to apply that only about 100 stars were measured by 1900.\n[\n54\n]\nDuring the 18–19th centuries, the study of the\nthree-body problem\nby\nLeonhard Euler\n,\nAlexis Claude Clairaut\n, and\nJean le Rond d'Alembert\nled to more accurate predictions about the motions of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by\nJoseph-Louis Lagrange\nand\nPierre Simon Laplace\n, allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations.\n[\n61\n]\nSignificant advances in astronomy came about with the introduction of new technology, including the\nspectroscope\nand\nastrophotography\n. In 1814–15,\nJoseph von Fraunhofer\ndiscovered some 574\ndark lines in the spectrum\nof the sun and of other stars.\n[\n62\n]\n[\n63\n]\nIn 1859,\nGustav Kirchhoff\nascribed these lines to the presence of different elements.\n[\n64\n]\nGalaxies\nDiagram of the stars, from William Herschel's\nOn the construction of the heavens\n.\n[\n65\n]\nIn the late 1700s\nWilliam Herschel\nmapped the distribution of stars in different directions from Earth, concluding that the universe consisted of the Sun near the center of disk of stars, the\nMilky Way\n. After\nJohn Michell\ndemonstrated that stars differ in intrinsic luminosity and after Herschel's own observations with more powerful telescopes that additional stars appeared in all directions, astronomers began to consider that some of the fuzzy\nspiral nebulae\nwere distant\nisland Universes\n.\n[\n54\n]\n: 6\nPhotograph of the\nGreat Andromeda \"Nebula\"\nby\nIsaac Roberts\nin 1888.\n[\n66\n]\n[\n67\n]\n: 63\nThe existence of galaxies, including the Earth's galaxy, the\nMilky Way\n, as a group of stars was only demonstrated in the 20th century.\n[\n68\n]\nIn 1912,\nHenrietta Leavitt\ndiscovered\nCepheid variable\nstars with well-defined, periodic luminosity changes which can be used to fix the star's true luminosity which then becomes an accurate tool for distance estimates. Using Cepheid variable stars,\nHarlow Shapley\nconstructed the first accurate map of the Milky Way.\n[\n54\n]\n: 7\nUsing the\nHooker Telescope\n,\nEdwin Hubble\nidentified Cepheid variables in several spiral nebulae and in 1922–1923 proved conclusively that\nAndromeda Nebula\nand\nTriangulum\namong others, were entire galaxies outside our own, thus proving that the universe consists of a multitude of galaxies.\n[\n69\n]\nCosmology\nMain article:\nHistory of physical cosmology\nAlbert Einstein\n's 1917 publication of\ngeneral relativity\nbegan the modern era of theoretical models of the universe as a whole.\n[\n70\n]\nIn  1922,\nAlexander Friedman\npublished simplified models for the universe showing static, expanding and contracting solutions.\n[\n54\n]\n: 13\nIn 1929 Hubble published observations that the galaxies are all moving away from Earth with a velocity proportional to distance, a relation now known as\nHubble's law\n. This relation is expected if the\nuniverse is expanding\n.\n[\n54\n]\n: 13\nThe consequence that the universe was once very dense and hot, a\nBig Bang\nconcept expounded by\nGeorges Lemaître\nin 1927,\n[\n71\n]\nwas discussed but no experimental evidence was available to support it. From the 1940s on, nuclear reaction rates under high density conditions were studied leading to the development of a successful model of\nbig bang nucleosynthesis\nin the late 1940s and early 1950s. Then in 1965\ncosmic microwave background radiation\nwas discovered, cementing the evidence for the Big Bang.\n[\n54\n]\n: 16\nAstrophysics predicted the existence of objects such as\nblack holes\n[\n72\n]\nand\nneutron stars\n.\n[\n73\n]\n: 89\n[\n74\n]\nThese have been used to explain phenomena such as\nquasars\n[\n75\n]\nand\npulsars\n.\n[\n76\n]\nSpace telescopes\nhave enabled measurements in parts of the electromagnetic spectrum normally blocked or blurred by the atmosphere.\n[\n77\n]\nThe\nLIGO\nproject\ndetected evidence\nof\ngravitational waves\nin 2015.\n[\n78\n]\n[\n79\n]\nObservational astronomy\nMain article:\nObservational astronomy\nOverview of types of\nobservational astronomy\n, relating wavelengths and their observability\nObservational astronomy relies on many different wavelengths of\nelectromagnetic radiation\nand the forms of astronomy are  categorized according to the corresponding region of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum\non which the observations are made.\n[\n80\n]\nSpecific information on these subfields is given below.\nRadio\nThe\nVery Large Array\nin\nNew Mexico\n, a\nradio telescope\nMain article:\nRadio astronomy\nRadio astronomy uses radiation with long\nwavelengths\n, mainly between 1 millimeter and 15 meters (frequencies from 20 MHz to 300 GHz), far outside the visible range.\n[\n81\n]\nHydrogen\n, otherwise an invisible gas, produces a\nspectral line\nat 21 cm (1420 MHz) which is observable at radio wavelengths.\n[\n82\n]\nObjects observable at radio wavelengths include interstellar gas,\n[\n82\n]\npulsars\n,\n[\n82\n]\nfast radio bursts\n,\n[\n82\n]\nsupernovae\n,\n[\n83\n]\nand\nactive galactic nuclei\n.\n[\n84\n]\nInfrared\nMain article:\nInfrared astronomy\nThe\nSubaru Telescope\n(left) and\nKeck Observatory\n(center) on\nMauna Kea\n, both observatories that operate at near-infrared and visible wavelengths. The\nNASA Infrared Telescope Facility\n(right) is an example of a telescope that operates only at near-infrared wavelengths.\nInfrared astronomy detects\ninfrared\nradiation with wavelengths longer than red\nvisible light\n, outside the range of our vision. The infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light, such as planets,\ncircumstellar disks\nor nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in\nmolecular clouds\nand the cores of galaxies. Observations from the\nWide-field Infrared Survey Explorer\n(WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous galactic\nprotostars\nand their host\nstar clusters\n.\n[\n85\n]\n[\n86\n]\nWith the exception of infrared\nwavelengths\nclose to visible light, such radiation is heavily absorbed by the atmosphere, or masked, as the atmosphere itself produces significant infrared emission. Consequently, infrared observatories have to be located in high, dry places on Earth or in space.\n[\n87\n]\nSome molecules radiate strongly in the infrared. This allows the study of the chemistry of space.\n[\n88\n]\nThe\nJames Webb Space Telescope\nsenses infrared radiation to detect very distant galaxies. Visible light from these galaxies was emitted billions of years ago and the\nexpansion of the universe\nshifted the light in to the infrared range. By studying these distant galaxies astronomers hope to learn about the formation of the first galaxies.\n[\n89\n]\nOptical\nMain article:\nOptical astronomy\nHistorically, optical astronomy, which has been also called visible light astronomy, is the oldest form of astronomy.\n[\n90\n]\nImages of observations were originally drawn by hand. In the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using\ncharge-coupled devices\n(CCDs) and recorded on modern medium. Although visible light itself extends from approximately 380 to 700\nnm\n[\n91\n]\nthat same equipment can be used to observe some\nnear-ultraviolet\nand\nnear-infrared\nradiation.\n[\n92\n]\nUltraviolet\nMain article:\nUltraviolet astronomy\nUltraviolet astronomy employs\nultraviolet\nwavelengths which are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, requiring observations from the upper atmosphere or from space. Ultraviolet astronomy is best suited to the study of thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue\nOB stars\nthat are very bright at these wavelengths.\n[\n93\n]\nX-ray\nMain article:\nX-ray astronomy\nX-ray jet made from a supermassive black hole found by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, made visible by light from the early Universe\nX-ray astronomy uses\nX-radiation\n, produced by extremely hot and high-energy processes. Since X-rays are absorbed by the\nEarth's atmosphere\n, observations must be performed at high altitude, such as from\nballoons\n,\nrockets\n, or\nspecialized satellites\n.\nX-ray sources\ninclude\nX-ray binaries\n,\nsupernova remnants\n,\nclusters of galaxies\n, and\nactive galactic nuclei\n.\n[\n94\n]\nSince the\nSun\n's surface is relatively cool, X-ray images of the Sun and other stars give valuable information on the hot solar\ncorona\n.\n[\n95\n]\nGamma-ray\nMain article:\nGamma ray astronomy\nGamma ray astronomy observes astronomical objects at the shortest wavelengths (highest energy) of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nGamma rays\nmay be observed directly by satellites such as the\nCompton Gamma Ray Observatory\n,\n[\n96\n]\nor by specialized telescopes called\natmospheric Cherenkov telescopes\n. Cherenkov telescopes do not detect the gamma rays directly but instead detect the flashes of visible light produced when gamma rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.\n[\n97\n]\n[\n98\n]\nGamma-ray astronomy provides information on the origin of\ncosmic rays\n, possible\nannihilation\nevents for\ndark matter\n, relativistic particles outflows from\nactive galactic nuclei\n(AGN), and, using AGN as distant sources, properties of intergalactic space.\n[\n99\n]\nGamma-ray bursts\n, which radiate transiently, are extremely energetic events, and are the brightest (most luminous) phenomena in the universe.\n[\n100\n]\nNon-electromagnetic observation\nThe underground\nANTARES neutrino telescope\nSome events originating from great distances may be observed from the Earth using systems that do not rely on electromagnetic radiation.\n[\n101\n]\n[\n102\n]\nIn\nneutrino astronomy\n, astronomers use heavily shielded\nunderground facilities\nsuch as\nSAGE\n,\nGALLEX\n, and\nKamioka II/III\nfor the detection of\nneutrinos\n. The vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the Earth originate from the\nSun\n, but 24 neutrinos were also detected from\nsupernova 1987A\n.\nCosmic rays\n, which consist of very high energy particles (atomic nuclei) that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, result in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories.\n[\n101\n]\nGravitational-wave astronomy\nemploys\ngravitational-wave detectors\nto collect observational data about distant massive objects. A few observatories have been constructed, such as the\nLaser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory\nLIGO\n.

Common targets include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets,\nmeteor showers\n, and\ndeep-sky objects\nsuch as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs throughout the world have programs to help their members set up and run observational programs such as to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues.\n[\n146\n]\n[\n147\n]\nMost amateurs work at visible wavelengths, but some have experimented with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum.

It is an old science, having its beginnings in prehistoric times.\n[\n3\n]\nAnatomy is inherently tied to\ndevelopmental biology\n,\nembryology\n,\ncomparative anatomy\n,\nevolutionary biology\n, and\nphylogeny\n,\n[\n4\n]\nas these are the processes by which anatomy is generated, both over immediate and long-term timescales. Anatomy and\nphysiology\n, which study the structure and\nfunction\nof organisms and their parts respectively, make a natural pair of related disciplines, and are often studied together.\nHuman anatomy\nis one of the essential\nbasic sciences\nthat are applied in medicine, and is often studied alongside\nphysiology\n.\n[\n5\n]\nAnatomy is a complex and dynamic field that is constantly evolving as discoveries are made. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the use of advanced imaging techniques, such as\nMRI\nand\nCT scans\n, which allow for more detailed and accurate visualizations of the body's structures.\nThe discipline of anatomy is divided into\nmacroscopic\nand\nmicroscopic\nparts.\nMacroscopic anatomy\n, or gross anatomy, is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided eyesight. Gross anatomy also includes the branch of\nsuperficial anatomy\n. Microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the\ntissues\nof various structures, known as\nhistology\n, and also in the study of\ncells\n.\nThe\nhistory of anatomy\nis characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the organs and structures of the human body. Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from the examination of animals by\ndissection\nof carcasses and\ncadavers\n(corpses)\n[\n6\n]\nto 20th-century\nmedical imaging\ntechniques, including\nX-ray\n,\nultrasound\n, and\nmagnetic resonance imaging\n.\n[\n7\n]\nEtymology and definition\n[\nedit\n]\nA dissected body, lying prone on a table, by\nCharles Landseer\nDerived from the Greek\nἀνατομή\nanatomē\n\"dissection\" (from\nἀνατέμνω\nanatémnō\n\"I cut up, cut open\" from ἀνά\naná\n\"up\", and τέμνω\ntémnō\n\"I cut\"),\n[\n8\n]\nanatomy is the scientific study of the structure of\norganisms\nincluding their systems,\norgans\nand\ntissues\n. It includes the appearance and position of the various parts, the materials from which they are composed, and their relationships with other parts. Anatomy is quite distinct from\nphysiology\nand\nbiochemistry\n, which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved. For example, an anatomist is concerned with the shape, size, position, structure, blood supply and innervation of an organ such as the liver; while a physiologist is interested in the production of\nbile\n, the role of the liver in nutrition and the regulation of bodily functions.\n[\n9\n]\nThe discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into a number of branches, including gross or\nmacroscopic\nanatomy and\nmicroscopic\nanatomy.\n[\n10\n]\nGross anatomy\nis the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and also includes\nsuperficial anatomy\nor surface anatomy, the study by sight of the external body features.\nMicroscopic anatomy\nis the study of structures on a microscopic scale, along with\nhistology\n(the study of tissues), and\nembryology\n(the study of an organism in its immature condition).\n[\n4\n]\nRegional anatomy is the study of the interrelationships of all of the structures in a specific body region, such as the abdomen. In contrast, systemic anatomy is the study of the structures that make up a discrete body system—that is, a group of structures that work together to perform a unique body function, such as the digestive system.\n[\n11\n]\nAnatomy can be studied using both invasive and non-invasive methods with the goal of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems.\n[\n4\n]\nMethods used include\ndissection\n, in which a body is opened and its organs studied, and\nendoscopy\n, in which a\nvideo camera\n-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures.\nAngiography\n, using\nX-rays\nor\nmagnetic resonance angiography\n, is a method to visualize blood vessels.\n[\n12\n]\n[\n13\n]\n[\n14\n]\n[\n15\n]\nThe term \"anatomy\" is commonly taken to refer to\nhuman anatomy\n. However, substantially similar structures and tissues are found throughout the rest of the animal kingdom, and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals. The term\nzootomy\nis also sometimes used to specifically refer to non-human animals. The structure and tissues of plants are of a dissimilar nature and they are studied in\nplant anatomy\n.\n[\n9\n]\nAnimal tissues\n[\nedit\n]\nStylized cutaway diagram of an animal cell (with flagella)\nThe animal\nkingdom\n(\nAnimalia\n) contains\nmulticellular organisms\nthat are\nheterotrophic\nand\nmotile\n(although some have secondarily adopted a\nsessile\nlifestyle). Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate\ntissues\nand these animals are also known as\neumetazoans\n. They have an internal\ndigestive\nchamber, with one or two openings; the\ngametes\nare produced in multicellular sex organs, and the\nzygotes\ninclude a\nblastula\nstage in their\nembryonic development\n. Metazoans do not include the\nsponges\n, which have undifferentiated cells.\n[\n16\n]\nUnlike\nplant cells\n,\nanimal cells\nhave neither a cell wall nor\nchloroplasts\n.\nVacuoles\n, when present, are more numerous and much smaller than those in the plant cell. The body tissues are composed of numerous types of cells, including those found in muscles, nerves and skin. Each typically has a cell membrane formed of\nphospholipids\n,\ncytoplasm\nand a\nnucleus\n. All of the different cells of an animal are derived from the embryonic\ngerm layers\n. Those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers of ectoderm and endoderm are called\ndiploblastic\nand the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called\ntriploblastic\n.\n[\n17\n]\nAll of a triploblastic animal's tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers of the embryo, the\nectoderm\n,\nmesoderm\nand\nendoderm\n.\nAnimal tissues can be grouped into four basic types:\nconnective\n,\nepithelial\n,\nmuscle\nand\nnervous tissue\n.\nHyaline cartilage at high magnification (\nH&E stain\n)\nConnective tissue\n[\nedit\n]\nConnective tissues\nare fibrous and made up of cells scattered among inorganic material called the\nextracellular matrix\n. Often called\nfascia\n(from the Latin \"fascia,\" meaning \"band\" or \"bandage\"), connective tissues give shape to organs and hold them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue,\nadipose tissue\n, fibrous connective tissue,\ncartilage\nand bone. The extracellular matrix contains\nproteins\n, the chief and most abundant of which is\ncollagen\n. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An\nexoskeleton\nis a thickened, rigid\ncuticle\nwhich is stiffened by\nmineralization\n, as in\ncrustaceans\nor by the cross-linking of its proteins as in\ninsects\n. An\nendoskeleton\nis internal and present in all developed animals, as well as in many of those less developed.\n[\n17\n]\nEpithelium\n[\nedit\n]\nGastric mucosa at low magnification (\nH&E stain\n)\nEpithelial tissue\nis composed of closely packed cells, bound to each other by\ncell adhesion molecules\n, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be\nsquamous\n(flat),\ncuboidal\nor\ncolumnar\nand rest on a\nbasal lamina\n, the upper layer of the\nbasement membrane\n,\n[\n18\n]\nthe lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells.\n[\n19\n]\nThere are many different types of epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the\nrespiratory tract\nthere is a type of\nciliated\nepithelial lining; in the small intestine there are\nmicrovilli\non the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are\nintestinal villi\n. Skin consists of an outer layer of\nkeratinized\nstratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body.\nKeratinocytes\nmake up to 95% of the cells in the\nskin\n.\n[\n20\n]\nThe epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a\ncuticle\n. In simple animals this may just be a coat of\nglycoproteins\n.\n[\n17\n]\nIn more advanced animals, many\nglands\nare formed of epithelial cells.\n[\n21\n]\nMuscle tissue\n[\nedit\n]\nCross section through\nskeletal muscle\nand a small\nnerve\nat high magnification (\nH&E stain\n)\nMuscle cells\n(myocytes) form the active contractile tissue of the body.\nMuscle tissue\nfunctions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile\nfilaments\nand is separated into three main types;\nsmooth muscle\n,\nskeletal muscle\nand\ncardiac muscle\n.\nSmooth muscle has no\nstriations\nwhen examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractility over a wide range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as\nsea anemone\ntentacles and the body wall of\nsea cucumbers\n. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in\nearthworms\nthat can extend slowly or make rapid contractions.\n[\n22\n]\nIn higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the\nuterus\n,\nbladder\n,\nintestines\n,\nstomach\n,\noesophagus\n,\nrespiratory airways\n, and\nblood vessels\n.\nCardiac muscle\nis found only in the\nheart\n, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.\nNervous tissue\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nNeuroanatomy\nNervous tissue\nis composed of many nerve cells known as\nneurons\nwhich transmit information. In some slow-moving\nradially symmetrical\nmarine animals such as\nctenophores\nand\ncnidarians\n(including\nsea anemones\nand\njellyfish\n), the nerves form a\nnerve net\n, but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as\nchemoreceptors\nand\nphotoreceptors\nare found in groups and send messages along\nneural networks\nto other parts of the organism. Neurons can be connected together in\nganglia\n.\n[\n23\n]\nIn higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a\ncentral nervous system\n(brain and spinal cord) and a\nperipheral nervous system\n. The latter consists of\nsensory nerves\nthat transmit information from sense organs and\nmotor nerves\nthat influence target organs.\n[\n24\n]\n[\n25\n]\nThe peripheral nervous system is divided into the\nsomatic nervous system\nwhich conveys sensation and controls\nvoluntary muscle\n, and the\nautonomic nervous system\nwhich involuntarily controls\nsmooth muscle\n, certain glands and internal organs, including the\nstomach\n.\n[\n26\n]\nVertebrate anatomy\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nVertebrate § Physical\n, and\nComparative anatomy\nMouse\nskull. The neck and most of the forelimbs are also seen.\nAll\nvertebrates\nhave a similar basic\nbody plan\nand at some point in their lives, mostly in the\nembryonic\nstage, share the major\nchordate\ncharacteristics: a stiffening rod, the\nnotochord\n; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the\nneural tube\n;\npharyngeal arches\n; and a tail posterior to the anus. The\nspinal cord\nis protected by the\nvertebral column\nand is above the notochord, and the\ngastrointestinal tract\nis below it.\n[\n27\n]\nNervous tissue is derived from the\nectoderm\n, connective tissues are derived from\nmesoderm\n, and gut is derived from the\nendoderm\n. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the\nanus\nat the base of the tail.\n[\n28\n]\nThe defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the\nvertebral column\n, formed in the development of the segmented series of\nvertebrae\n. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the\nnucleus pulposus\nof the\nintervertebral discs\n. However, a few vertebrates, such as the\nsturgeon\nand the\ncoelacanth\n, retain the notochord into adulthood.\n[\n29\n]\nJawed vertebrates\nare typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be\nhomologous\nbecause the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their\nlast common ancestor\n. This is one of the arguments put forward by\nCharles Darwin\nto support his theory of\nevolution\n.\n[\n30\n]\nFish anatomy\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nFish anatomy\nCutaway diagram showing various organs of a fish\nThe body of a\nfish\nis divided into a head, trunk and tail, although the divisions between the three are not always externally visible. The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish, is either made of cartilage, in\ncartilaginous fish\n, or bone in\nbony fish\n. The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating\nvertebrae\nwhich are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine and there are no\nlimbs\nor limb girdles. The main external features of the fish, the\nfins\n, are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which with the exception of the\ncaudal fins\n, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk.\n[\n31\n]\nThe heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the\ngills\nand on round the body in a single circulatory loop.\n[\n32\n]\nThe eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision. There is an inner ear but no external or\nmiddle ear\n. Low frequency vibrations are detected by the\nlateral line\nsystem of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish, and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.\n[\n31\n]\nSharks and rays are\nbasal\nfish with numerous\nprimitive\nanatomical features similar to those of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage. Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set on the underside of the head. The dermis is covered with separate dermal\nplacoid scales\n. They have a\ncloaca\ninto which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a\nswim bladder\n. Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large,\nyolky\neggs. Some species are\novoviviparous\nand the young develop internally but others are\noviparous\nand the larvae develop externally in egg cases.\n[\n33\n]\nThe bony fish lineage shows more\nderived\nanatomical traits, often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish. They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an\noperculum\n, and a mouth at or near the tip of the snout. The dermis is covered with overlapping\nscales\n. Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column, but not a cloaca. They mostly\nspawn\na large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column.\n[\n33\n]\nAmphibian anatomy\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nAmphibian anatomy\nSkeleton of\nSurinam horned frog\n(\nCeratophrys cornuta\n)\nPlastic model of a frog\nAmphibians\nare a\nclass\nof animals comprising\nfrogs\n,\nsalamanders\nand\ncaecilians\n. They are\ntetrapods\n, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have\narticular processes\n. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little\nkeratin\nand lacks scales, but contains many\nmucous glands\nand in some species, poison glands. The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two\natria\nand one\nventricle\n. They have a\nurinary bladder\nand\nnitrogenous waste products\nare excreted primarily as\nurea\n. Amphibians breathe by means of\nbuccal pumping\n, a pump action in which air is first drawn into the\nbuccopharyngeal\nregion through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat.\n[\n34\n]\nThey supplement this with\ngas exchange\nthrough the skin which needs to be kept moist.\n[\n35\n]\nIn frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs. The feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing. Frogs have large eyes and no tail. Salamanders resemble lizards in appearance; their short legs project sideways, the belly is close to or in contact with the ground and they have a long tail. Caecilians superficially resemble\nearthworms\nand are limbless. They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side.\n[\n36\n]\nReptile anatomy\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nReptile anatomy\nSkeleton of a\nwestern diamondback rattlesnake\nReptiles\nare a class of\nanimals\ncomprising\nturtles\n,\ntuataras\n,\nlizards\n,\nsnakes\nand\ncrocodiles\n. They are\ntetrapods\n, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their\nlungs\nby expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a\ncopulatory organ\npresent in most species. The eggs are surrounded by\namniotic membranes\nwhich prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or\ndevelop internally\nin some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as\nuric acid\n.\n[\n37\n]\nTurtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny\ncarapace\nabove and a\nplastron\nbelow. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.\n[\n38\n]\nTuataras\nsuperficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the\nTriassic\nperiod. There is one living species,\nSphenodon punctatus\n. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down. The brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles, and the lungs have a single chamber and lack\nbronchi\n. The tuatara has a well-developed\nparietal eye\non its forehead.\n[\n38\n]\nLizards have skulls with only one\nfenestra\non each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.\n[\n38\n]\nSnakes are closely related to lizards, having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the\nCretaceous\nperiod, and they share many of the same features. The skeleton consists of a skull, a hyoid bone, spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of\npelvic spurs\n. The bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole. Snakes lack moveable eyelids, the eyes being covered by transparent \"spectacle\" scales. They do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull. Their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warm-blooded prey.\n[\n39\n]\nCrocodilians\nare large, low-slung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.\n[\n40\n]\nBird anatomy\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nBird anatomy\nPart of a wing.\nAlbrecht Dürer\n,\nc.\n1500–1512\nBirds\nare\ntetrapods\nbut though their hind limbs are used for walking or hopping, their front limbs are\nwings\ncovered with\nfeathers\nand adapted for flight. Birds are\nendothermic\n, have a high\nmetabolic rate\n, a light\nskeletal system\nand powerful\nmuscles\n. The long bones are thin, hollow and very light. Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.\n[\n41\n]\nThe feathers are outgrowths of the\nepidermis\nand are found in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin. Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds. The only cutaneous gland is the single\nuropygial gland\nnear the base of the tail. This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird\npreens\n. There are scales on the legs, feet and claws on the tips of the toes.\n[\n41\n]\nMammal anatomy\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMammal anatomy\nMammals\nare a diverse class of animals, mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight. They mostly have four limbs, but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins, and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of\nprismatic enamel\n. The teeth are shed once (\nmilk teeth\n) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, as is the case in\ncetaceans\n. Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a\ncochlea\nin the\ninner ear\n. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete\nsweat\n. Some of these glands are specialized as\nmammary glands\n, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with\nlungs\nand have a muscular\ndiaphragm\nseparating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers, and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.\n[\n42\n]\nMammals are\namniotes\n, and most are\nviviparous\n, giving birth to live young. Exceptions to this are the egg-laying\nmonotremes\n, the\nplatypus\nand the\nechidnas\nof Australia. Most other mammals have a\nplacenta\nthrough which the developing\nfoetus\nobtains nourishment, but in\nmarsupials\n, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's\npouch\nwhere it latches on to a\nteat\nand completes its development.\n[\n42\n]\nHuman anatomy\n[\nedit\n]\nFurther information:\nHuman anatomy\nand\nOutline of human anatomy\nSagittal sections of the head as seen by a modern\nMRI\nscan\nIn humans, dexterous hand movements and increased brain size are likely to have evolved simultaneously.\n[\n43\n]\nHumans\nhave the overall body plan of a mammal. Humans have a head, neck,\ntrunk\n(which includes the\nthorax\nand\nabdomen\n), two arms and hands, and two legs and feet.\nGenerally, students of certain\nbiological sciences\n,\nparamedics\n, prosthetists and orthotists,\nphysiotherapists\n,\noccupational therapists\n,\nnurses\n,\npodiatrists\n, and\nmedical students\nlearn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of\ndissection\nand inspection of\ncadavers\n. The study of microscopic anatomy (or\nhistology\n) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a\nmicroscope\n.\n[\n44\n]\nHuman anatomy, physiology and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school. Human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically; that is, respectively, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systems.\n[\n4\n]\nThe major anatomy textbook,\nGray's Anatomy\n, has been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format, in line with modern teaching methods.\n[\n45\n]\n[\n46\n]\nA thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians, especially\nsurgeons\nand doctors working in some diagnostic specialties, such as\nhistopathology\nand\nradiology\n.\n[\n47\n]\nAcademic anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools or teaching hospitals. They are often involved in teaching anatomy, and research into certain systems, organs, tissues or cells.\n[\n47\n]\nInvertebrate anatomy\n[\nedit\n]\nHead of a male\nDaphnia\n, a\nplanktonic\ncrustacean\nInvertebrates\nconstitute a vast array of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular\neukaryotes\nsuch as\nParamecium\nto such complex multicellular animals as the\noctopus\n,\nlobster\nand\ndragonfly\n. They constitute about 95% of the animal species. By definition, none of these creatures has a backbone. The cells of single-cell\nprotozoans\nhave the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs. Locomotion is often provided by\ncilia\nor\nflagella\nor may proceed via the advance of\npseudopodia\n, food may be gathered by\nphagocytosis\n, energy needs may be supplied by\nphotosynthesis\nand the cell may be supported by an\nendoskeleton\nor an\nexoskeleton\n. Some protozoans can form multicellular colonies.\n[\n48\n]\nMetazoans\nare a multicellular organism, with different groups of cells serving different functions. The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, both of which are present in nearly all invertebrates. The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an\nextracellular matrix\nwhich provides support to the organism. An endoskeleton derived from the\nmesoderm\nis present in\nechinoderms\n,\nsponges\nand some\ncephalopods\n.\nExoskeletons\nare derived from the epidermis and is composed of\nchitin\nin\narthropods\n(insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters).\nCalcium carbonate\nconstitutes the shells of\nmolluscs\n,\nbrachiopods\nand some tube-building\npolychaete worms\nand\nsilica\nforms the exoskeleton of the microscopic\ndiatoms\nand\nradiolaria\n.\n[\n49\n]\nOther invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the\npinacoderm\nof sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians (\npolyps\n,\nsea anemones\n,\njellyfish\n) and the\ncollagenous\ncuticle of\nannelids\n. The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. There may also be protrusions such as\nmicrovilli\n, cilia, bristles,\nspines\nand\ntubercles\n.\n[\n50\n]\nMarcello Malpighi\n, the father of microscopical anatomy, discovered that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm. He observed that when a ring-like portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring, and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food coming down from the leaves, and being captured above the ring.\n[\n51\n]\nArthropod anatomy\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nArthropod\n,\nInsect morphology\n, and\nSpider anatomy\nArthropods\ncomprise the largest phylum of\ninvertebrates\nin the animal kingdom with over a million known species.\n[\n52\n]\nInsects\npossess\nsegmented\nbodies supported by a hard-jointed outer covering, the\nexoskeleton\n, made mostly of\nchitin\n. The segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts, a head, a\nthorax\nand an\nabdomen\n.\n[\n53\n]\nThe head typically bears a pair of sensory\nantennae\n, a pair of\ncompound eyes\n, one to three simple eyes (\nocelli\n) and three sets of modified appendages that form the\nmouthparts\n. The thorax has three pairs of segmented\nlegs\n, one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax and one or two pairs of\nwings\n. The abdomen is composed of eleven segments, some of which may be fused and houses the\ndigestive\n,\nrespiratory\n,\nexcretory\nand reproductive systems.\n[\n54\n]\nThere is considerable variation between species and many adaptations to the body parts, especially wings, legs, antennae and mouthparts.\n[\n55\n]\nSpiders\na class of\narachnids\nhave four pairs of legs; a body of two segments—a\ncephalothorax\nand an\nabdomen\n. Spiders have no wings and no antennae. They have mouthparts called\nchelicerae\nwhich are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous. They have a second pair of appendages called\npedipalps\nattached to the cephalothorax. These have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs. At the end of each male pedipalp is a spoon-shaped cymbium that acts to support the\ncopulatory organ\n.\nOther branches of anatomy\n[\nedit\n]\nSurface anatomy\nis important as the study of anatomical landmarks that can be readily seen from the exterior contours of the body.\n[\n4\n]\nIt enables medics and\nveterinarians\nto gauge the position and anatomy of the associated deeper structures. Superficial is a directional term that indicates that structures are located relatively close to the surface of the body.\n[\n56\n]\nComparative anatomy\nrelates to the comparison of anatomical structures (both gross and microscopic) in different animals.\n[\n4\n]\nArtistic anatomy\nrelates to anatomic studies of\nbody proportions\nfor artistic reasons.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nHistory of anatomy\nAncient\n[\nedit\n]\nImage of early rendition of anatomy findings\nIn 1600 BCE, the\nEdwin Smith Papyrus\n, an\nAncient Egyptian\nmedical text\n, described the\nheart\nand its vessels, as well as the brain and its\nmeninges\nand\ncerebrospinal fluid\n, and the\nliver\n,\nspleen\n,\nkidneys\n,\nuterus\nand\nbladder\n. It showed the\nblood vessels\ndiverging from the heart.\n[\n57\n]\n[\n58\n]\n[\n59\n]\nThe\nEbers Papyrus\n(\nc.\n1550 BCE\n) features a \"treatise on the heart\", with vessels carrying all the body's fluids to or from every member of the body.\n[\n60\n]\nAncient Greek anatomy and physiology underwent great changes and advances throughout the early medieval world. Over time, this medical practice expanded due to a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body. Phenomenal anatomical observations of the human body were made, which contributed to the understanding of the brain, eye, liver, reproductive organs, and nervous system.\nThe\nHellenistic Egyptian\ncity of\nAlexandria\nwas the stepping-stone for Greek anatomy and physiology. Alexandria not only housed the biggest library for medical records and books of the liberal arts in the world during the time of the Greeks but was also home to many medical practitioners and philosophers. Great patronage of the arts and sciences from the\nPtolemaic dynasty\nof Egypt helped raise Alexandria up, further rivalling other Greek states' cultural and scientific achievements.\n[\n61\n]\nAn anatomy\nthangka\n, part of\nDesi Sangye Gyatso\n's The Blue Beryl, 17th century\nSome of the most striking advances in early anatomy and physiology took place in Hellenistic Alexandria.\n[\n61\n]\nTwo of the most famous anatomists and physiologists of the third century were\nHerophilus\nand\nErasistratus\n. These two physicians helped pioneer human\ndissection\nfor medical research, using the cadavers of condemned criminals, which was considered taboo until the Renaissance—Herophilus was recognized as the first person to perform systematic dissections.\n[\n62\n]\nHerophilus became known for his anatomical works, making impressive contributions to many branches of anatomy and many other aspects of medicine.\n[\n63\n]\nSome of the works included classifying the system of the pulse, the discovery that human arteries had thicker walls than veins, and that the atria were parts of the heart. Herophilus's knowledge of the human body has provided vital input towards understanding the brain, eye, liver, reproductive organs, and nervous system and characterizing the course of the disease.\n[\n62\n]\nErasistratus accurately described the structure of the brain, including the cavities and membranes, and made a distinction between its cerebrum and cerebellum.\n[\n64\n]\nDuring his study in Alexandria, Erasistratus was particularly concerned with studies of the circulatory and nervous systems. He could distinguish the human body's sensory and motor nerves and believed air entered the lungs and heart, which was then carried throughout the body. His distinction between the arteries and veins—the arteries carrying the air through the body, while the veins carry the blood from the heart was a great anatomical discovery. Erasistratus was also responsible for naming and describing the function of the epiglottis and the heart's valves, including the tricuspid.\n[\n65\n]\nDuring the third century, Greek physicians were able to differentiate nerves from blood vessels and tendons\n[\n66\n]\nand to realize that the nerves convey neural impulses.\n[\n61\n]\nIt was Herophilus who made the point that damage to motor nerves induced paralysis.\n[\n62\n]\nHerophilus named the meninges and ventricles in the brain, appreciated the division between cerebellum and cerebrum and recognized that the brain was the \"seat of intellect\" and not a \"cooling chamber\" as propounded by Aristotle.\n[\n67\n]\nHerophilus is also credited with describing the optic, oculomotor, motor division of the trigeminal, facial, vestibulocochlear and hypoglossal nerves.\n[\n68\n]\nSurgical instruments were invented by\nAbulcasis\nin the 11th century\nAnatomy of the eye for the first time in history by\nHunayn ibn Ishaq\nin the 9th century\n13th century anatomical illustration\nIncredible feats were made during the third century BCE in both the digestive and reproductive systems. Herophilus discovered and described not only the salivary glands but also the small intestine and liver.\n[\n68\n]\nHe showed that the uterus is a hollow organ and described the ovaries and uterine tubes. He recognized that spermatozoa were produced by the testes and was the first to identify the prostate gland.\n[\n68\n]\nThe anatomy of the muscles and skeleton is described in the\nHippocratic Corpus\n, an Ancient Greek medical work written by unknown authors.\n[\n69\n]\nAristotle\ndescribed\nvertebrate\nanatomy based on animal\ndissection\n.\nPraxagoras\nidentified the difference between\narteries\nand\nveins\n. Also in the 4th century BCE,\nHerophilos\nand\nErasistratus\nproduced more accurate anatomical descriptions based on\nvivisection\nof criminals in\nAlexandria\nduring the\nPtolemaic period\n.\n[\n70\n]\n[\n71\n]\nIn the 2nd century,\nGalen of Pergamum\n, an anatomist,\nclinician\n, writer, and philosopher,\n[\n72\n]\nwrote the final and highly influential anatomy treatise of ancient times.\n[\n73\n]\nHe compiled existing knowledge and studied anatomy through the dissection of animals.\n[\n72\n]\nHe was one of the first experimental physiologists through his\nvivisection\nexperiments on animals.\n[\n74\n]\nGalen's drawings, based mostly on dog anatomy, became effectively the only anatomical textbook for the next thousand years.\n[\n75\n]\nHis work was known to\nRenaissance\ndoctors only through\nIslamic Golden Age\nmedicine until it was translated from Greek sometime in the 15th century.\n[\n75\n]\nMedieval to early modern\n[\nedit\n]\nAnatomical study of the arm, by\nLeonardo da Vinci\n, (about 1510)\nAnatomical chart in\nVesalius\n's\nEpitome\n, 1543\nMichiel Jansz van Mierevelt\n–\nAnatomy lesson of Dr. Willem van der Meer\n, 1617\nAnatomy developed little from classical times until the sixteenth century; as the historian Marie Boas writes, \"Progress in anatomy before the sixteenth century is as mysteriously slow as its development after 1500 is startlingly rapid\".\n[\n75\n]\n: 120–121\nBetween 1275 and 1326, the anatomists\nMondino de Luzzi\n,\nAlessandro Achillini\nand\nAntonio Benivieni\nat\nBologna\ncarried out the first systematic human dissections since ancient times.\n[\n76\n]\n[\n77\n]\n[\n78\n]\nMondino's\nAnatomy\nof 1316 was the first textbook in the medieval rediscovery of human anatomy. It describes the body in the order followed in Mondino's dissections, starting with the abdomen, thorax, head, and limbs. It was the standard anatomy textbook for the next century.\n[\n75\n]\nLeonardo da Vinci\n(1452–1519) was trained in anatomy by\nAndrea del Verrocchio\n.\n[\n75\n]\nHe made use of his anatomical knowledge in his artwork, making many sketches of skeletal structures, muscles and organs of humans and other vertebrates that he dissected.\n[\n75\n]\n[\n79\n]\nAndreas Vesalius\n(1514–1564), professor of anatomy at the\nUniversity of Padua\n, is considered the founder of modern human anatomy.\n[\n80\n]\nOriginally from\nBrabant\n, Vesalius published the influential book\nDe humani corporis fabrica\n(\"the structure of the human body\"), a large format book in seven volumes, in 1543.\n[\n81\n]\nThe accurate and intricately detailed illustrations, often in\nallegorical\nposes against Italianate landscapes, are thought to have been made by the artist\nJan van Calcar\n, a pupil of\nTitian\n.\n[\n82\n]\nIn England, anatomy was the subject of the first public lectures given in any science; these were provided by the\nCompany of Barbers and Surgeons\nin the 16th century, joined in 1583 by the Lumleian lectures in surgery at the\nRoyal College of Physicians\n.\n[\n83\n]\nLate modern\n[\nedit\n]\nFurther information:\nHistory of anatomy in the 19th century\nAnatomy teaching with female students, 1891–1893\nMedical schools began to be set up in the United States towards the end of the 18th century. Classes in anatomy needed a continual stream of cadavers for dissection, and these were difficult to obtain. Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New York were all renowned for\nbody snatching\nactivity as criminals raided graveyards at night, removing newly buried corpses from their coffins.\n[\n84\n]\nA similar problem existed in Britain where demand for bodies became so great that grave-raiding and even\nanatomy murder\nwere practised to obtain cadavers.\n[\n85\n]\nSome graveyards were, in consequence, protected with watchtowers. The practice was halted in Britain by the\nAnatomy Act\nof 1832,\n[\n86\n]\n[\n87\n]\nwhile in the United States, similar legislation was enacted after the physician\nWilliam S. Forbes\nof\nJefferson Medical College\nwas found guilty in 1882 of \"complicity with resurrectionists in the despoliation of graves in Lebanon Cemetery\".\n[\n88\n]\nThe teaching of anatomy in Britain was transformed by Sir\nJohn Struthers\n,\nRegius Professor of Anatomy\nat the\nUniversity of Aberdeen\nfrom 1863 to 1889. He was responsible for setting up the system of three years of \"pre-clinical\" academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine, including especially anatomy. This system lasted until the reform of medical training in 1993 and 2003. As well as teaching, he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of\ncomparative anatomy\n, published over 70 research papers, and became famous for his public dissection of the\nTay Whale\n.\n[\n89\n]\n[\n90\n]\nFrom 1822 the Royal College of Surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools.\n[\n91\n]\nMedical museums provided examples in comparative anatomy, and were often used in teaching.\n[\n92\n]\nIgnaz Semmelweis\ninvestigated\npuerperal fever\nand he discovered how it was caused. He noticed that the frequently fatal fever occurred more often in mothers examined by medical students than by midwives. The students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth. Semmelweis showed that when the trainees washed their hands in chlorinated lime before each clinical examination, the incidence of puerperal fever among the mothers could be reduced dramatically.\n[\n93\n]\nAn electron microscope from 1973\nBefore the modern medical era, the primary means for studying the internal structures of the body were\ndissection\nof the dead and\ninspection\n,\npalpation\n, and\nauscultation\nof the living. The advent of\nmicroscopy\nopened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of\nachromatic lenses\nincreased the\nresolving power\nof the microscope, and around 1839,\nMatthias Jakob Schleiden\nand\nTheodor Schwann\nidentified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. The study of small structures involved passing light through them, and the\nmicrotome\nwas invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different tissue types. Advances in the fields of\nhistology\nand\ncytology\nbegan in the late 19th century\n[\n94\n]\nalong with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of\nbiopsy\nspecimens. The invention of the\nelectron microscope\nbrought a significant advance in resolution power and allowed research into the\nultrastructure\nof cells and the\norganelles\nand other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of\nX-ray diffraction\nfor studying the crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of\nmolecular anatomy\n.\n[\n94\n]\nEqually important advances have occurred in\nnon-invasive\ntechniques for examining the body's interior structures.\nX-rays\ncan be passed through the body and used in medical\nradiography\nand\nfluoroscopy\nto differentiate interior structures that have varying degrees of opaqueness.\nMagnetic resonance imaging\n,\ncomputed tomography\n, and\nultrasound imaging\nhave all enabled the examination of internal structures in unprecedented detail to a degree far beyond the imagination of earlier generations.\n[\n7\n]\nInfrared and ultraviolet analysis, computer image processing, fractal analysis, metrological analysis using image analysis methods are modern methods useful especially in neuroanatomical research.\n[\n95\n]\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nAnatomical model\n– Three-dimensional representation of human or animal anatomy\nAnatomy portal\nBibliography of biology § Anatomy\nEvelyn tables\n– 17th century anatomical preparations\nOutline of human anatomy\n– Overview of and topical guide to human anatomy\nPlastination\n– Technique used in anatomy to preserve bodies or body parts\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\n\"De humani corporis fabrica libri septem.

The competitions are designed for the 4-6 best\nhigh school\nstudents from each participating country selected through internal National Science Olympiads, with the exception of the IOL, which allows two teams per country, the IOI, which allows two teams from the hosting country, and the IJSO, which is designed for junior secondary students and also allows two teams from the hosting country. Early editions of the first Olympiads were limited to the\nEastern Bloc\n, but later they gradually spread to other countries.\n[\n1\n]\nOverview\nThe Olympiads themselves are separate competitions each with its own organizing body, even though they are loosely grouped together as \"ISOs\". The aims of each ISO are to promote a career in science; to challenge the brightest students from around the world; and to compare the various teaching systems of each country. Although the competitions are aimed for secondary school pupils, the standards of the exams are extremely high.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nInternational Science Olympiads\nScience\nOlympiads are international\nstudent\ncompetitions.

However, they are not the official organizer of Olympiads in India.\n[\n1\n]\nOlympiads\n[\nedit\n]\nEvery year over 91000+ schools from 70+ countries register for the 8 Olympiad exams and millions of students appear in them.\nCurrent\n[\nedit\n]\nAnnually, about 5 million students take part in each of the following Olympiad exams:\nInternational Computer Science Olympiad (ICSO)\nis a single level exam. It was the second Olympiad conducted by SOF. It has been conducted since 2000. Students from class I-X may participate in the examination.\nNational Science Olympiad (NSO)\nis conducted at two levels each year. It was the first Olympiad conducted by SOF. It has been conducted since 1998. Students from class I-XII may participate in the examination.\nInternational Mathematics Olympiad (IMO)\nis conducted at two levels each year. Students from class I-XII may participate in the examination.\nInternational English Olympiad (IEO)\nused to be a single level exam each year, but since 2017–2018 it is conducted at two levels. Students from class I-XII can participate in this Olympiad.\nInternational General Knowledge Olympiad (IGKO)\nis a single level exam. Students from classes I-X may participate in the examination. This Olympiad was introduced in the 2017–2018 academic session.\nInternational Commerce Olympiad (ICO)\nis a single level exam. Students from classes XI and XII may participate in the examination. It is conducted in partnership with\nICSI\n.\n[\n2\n]\nUnder The Ministry of Corporate Affairs.\nSOF International Social Studies Olympiad (ISSO)\nis a single level exam. Students from classes III-X may participate in the examination.\nSOF International Hindi Olympiad (IHO)\nis a single level exam. Students from classes III-X may participate in the examination.\nFormer\n[\nedit\n]\nNational Cyber Olympiad Level-2 (NCO) was formerly a two-level exam, but it has been converted to a single level exam since 2017–18.\nInternational Sports Knowledge Olympiad (ISKO) was conducted only once, during the 2016–2017 session. It was a single level exam conducted in partnership with Star Sports in which students of classes 1 to 10 could participate.\nEligibility and pattern\n[\nedit\n]\nFor Level 1\n:\nStudents from classes 1 through 12\n[\nclarification needed\n]\ncan participate. The exams consist of 35\nmultiple choice questions\nof 40 marks for classes I to IV, and 50\nmultiple choice questions\nfor classes V to XII of 60 marks, to be answered in one hour. Five questions that are part of the 'Achievers' section' carry three marks (and for primary classes excluding 5th, it has only two marks) each whereas the remaining questions carry one mark each. Students are required to mark their answers on an\nOMR\nsheet. Results are announced for every student and they include the student's international rank, regional rank (since 2020-21),\n[\n3\n]\nzonal rank, city rank and school rank and winners are awarded with cash prizes, medals, trophies, gift certificates and Merit Certificates. SOF also generates a performance report for all participating students and schools, as well as awards teachers and principals whose pupils excelled in the exam.\n[\n4\n]\nSOF also runs 3 scholarship Schemes for under privileged girl students, for students from defence and internal security families and for academically brilliant students.\nFor Level 2:\nIf fulfilled the eligibility criteria, students participated in the Level 1 olympiads of NSO, IMO, IEO qualify for the Level 2 conducted at various centres in India.\nControversies\n[\nedit\n]\nAlthough being a non-governmental organisation it works on a profit-making model and charges heavily for its books and study materials. Silver Zone Foundation, a similar 14-year-old Olympiad company, rakes in 50% of its revenues from book sales and the rest from exam registration fees (at Rs 120 per student). Close to a million kids from 5,000 schools have been sitting their Olympiads every year, claims CEO Kamal Kishore.\n[\n5\n]\nQuestions are deliberately asked from their own books which are not according to state prescribed board syllabi which compel students to buy their expensive books.\nThe foundation has been criticized by Anwesh Mazumdar, national coordinator, Science Olympiads from the academics at Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education saying, \"It is a misrepresentation to call a competition an Olympiad if it has no culmination on the international stage.\" He argues that the original science Olympiads — the first was in Maths held in Romania in 1959 — pursue nobler goals of intellectual inquiry. \"These companies should not call it an 'Olympiad'; call it a competition if necessary. For example, the International Mathematical Olympiad is the real deal, but Science Olympiad Foundation, a private organisation, has an exam called the International Mathematics Olympiad, parents are misled and even the international organisers are concerned,\" says Mazumdar, adding that they have contemplated patenting the name.\n[\n6\n]\nThere have been demands for government intervention to regulate the exams. Ashok Pandey, director at Ahlcon International School in Delhi, admits that private Olympiads need to be better regulated. \"I had initially decided not to host them, but gave in when parents insisted,\" says Pandey.\n[\n6\n]\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\n\"About Science Olympiad Foundation (SOF)\"\n.\nScience Olympiad Foundation\n.

The mantle is not quite solid and consists of\nmagma\nwhich is in a state of semi-perpetual\nconvection\n. This convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move, albeit slowly. The resulting process is known as plate tectonics.\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\n[\n10\n]\nAreas of the crust where new crust is created are called\ndivergent boundaries\n, those where it is brought back into the Earth are\nconvergent boundaries\nand those where plates slide past each other, but no new lithospheric material is created or destroyed, are referred to as\ntransform\n(or conservative) boundaries.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\nEarthquakes\nresult from the movement of the lithospheric plates, and they often occur near convergent boundaries where parts of the crust are forced into the earth as part of subduction.\n[\n12\n]\nPlate tectonics might be thought of as the process by which the Earth is resurfaced. As the result of\nseafloor spreading\n, new crust and lithosphere is created by the flow of magma from the\nmantle\nto the near surface, through fissures, where it cools and solidifies. Through\nsubduction\n, oceanic crust and lithosphere vehemently returns to the convecting mantle.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n10\n]\n[\n13\n]\nVolcanoes result primarily from the melting of subducted crust material. Crust material that is forced into the\nasthenosphere\nmelts, and some portion of the melted material becomes light enough to rise to the surface—giving birth to volcanoes.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n12\n]\nAtmospheric science\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nAtmospheric science\nThe\nmagnetosphere\nshields the surface of Earth from the charged particles of the\nsolar wind\n.\n(\nimage not to scale.\n)\nAtmospheric science initially developed in the late-19th century as a means to forecast the weather through\nmeteorology\n, the study of weather.\nAtmospheric chemistry\nwas developed in the 20th century to measure\nair pollution\nand expanded in the 1970s in response to\nacid rain\n.\nClimatology\nstudies the\nclimate\nand\nclimate change\n.\n[\n14\n]\nThe\ntroposphere\n,\nstratosphere\n,\nmesosphere\n,\nthermosphere\n, and\nexosphere\nare the five layers which make up Earth's atmosphere. 75% of the mass in the atmosphere is located within the troposphere, the lowest layer.

The magnetic field is generated by\nelectric currents\ndue to the motion of\nconvection currents\nof a mixture of molten\niron\nand\nnickel\nin\nEarth's outer core\n: these convection currents are caused by heat escaping from the core, a natural process called a\ngeodynamo\n.\nThe magnitude of Earth's magnetic field  at its surface ranges from 25 to 65 μT (0.25 to 0.65 G).\n[\n23\n]\nAs an approximation, it is represented by a field of a\nmagnetic dipole\ncurrently tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to\nEarth's rotational\naxis, as if there were an enormous\nbar magnet\nplaced at that angle through the center of Earth. The\nNorth geomagnetic pole\n(\nEllesmere Island\n,\nNunavut\n, Canada) actually represents the South pole of Earth's magnetic field, and conversely the\nSouth geomagnetic pole\ncorresponds to the north pole of Earth's magnetic field (because opposite magnetic poles attract and the north end of a magnet, like a compass needle, points toward Earth's South magnetic field.)\nWhile the North and South\nmagnetic poles\nare usually located near the\ngeographic poles\n, they slowly and continuously move over geological time scales, but sufficiently slowly for ordinary\ncompasses\nto remain useful for navigation. However, at irregular intervals averaging several hundred thousand years,\nEarth's field reverses\nand the\nNorth\nand\nSouth Magnetic Poles\nabruptly switch places. These reversals of the\ngeomagnetic poles\nleave a record in rocks that are of value to\npaleomagnetists\nin calculating geomagnetic fields in the past. Such information in turn is helpful in studying the motions of continents and ocean floors. The\nmagnetosphere\nis defined by the extent of Earth's magnetic field in space or\ngeospace\n. It extends above the\nionosphere\n, several tens of thousands of kilometres into\nspace\n, protecting Earth from the charged particles of the\nsolar wind\nand\ncosmic rays\nthat would otherwise strip away the upper atmosphere, including the\nozone layer\nthat protects Earth from\nharmful ultraviolet radiation\n.\nHydrology\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nHydrology\nMovement of water through the\nwater cycle\nHydrology is the study of the hydrosphere and the\nmovement of water on Earth\n. It emphasizes the study of how humans use and interact with freshwater supplies. Study of water's movement is closely related to\ngeomorphology\nand other branches of Earth science. Applied hydrology involves engineering to maintain aquatic environments and distribute water supplies. Subdisciplines of hydrology include\noceanography\n,\nhydrogeology\n,\necohydrology\n, and\nglaciology\n. Oceanography is the study of oceans.\n[\n24\n]\nHydrogeology is the study of\ngroundwater\n. It includes the mapping of groundwater supplies and the analysis of groundwater contaminants. Applied hydrogeology seeks to prevent contamination of groundwater and\nmineral springs\nand make it available as\ndrinking water\n. The earliest exploitation of groundwater resources dates back to 3000 BC, and hydrogeology as a science was developed by hydrologists beginning in the 17th century.\n[\n25\n]\nEcohydrology is the study of ecological systems in the\nhydrosphere\n. It can be divided into the physical study of aquatic ecosystems and the biological study of aquatic organisms. Ecohydrology includes the effects that organisms and aquatic ecosystems have on one another as well as how these ecosystems are affected by humans.\n[\n26\n]\nGlaciology is the study of the cryosphere, including\nglaciers\nand coverage of the Earth by ice and snow. Concerns of glaciology include access to glacial freshwater, mitigation of glacial hazards, obtaining resources that exist beneath frozen land, and addressing the effects of climate change on the cryosphere.\n[\n27\n]\nEcology\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nEcology\nEcology is the study of the\nbiosphere\n. This includes the study of nature and of how living things interact with the Earth and one another and the consequences of that. It considers how living things use resources such as\noxygen\n,\nwater\n, and\nnutrients\nfrom the Earth to sustain themselves. It also considers how humans and other living creatures cause changes to nature.\n[\n28\n]\nPhysical geography\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nPhysical geography\nPhysical geography is the study of\nEarth's systems\nand how they interact with one another as part of a single self-contained system. It incorporates astronomy, mathematical geography, meteorology, climatology, geology, geomorphology, biology, biogeography, pedology, and soils geography. Physical geography is distinct from\nhuman geography\n, which studies the human populations on Earth, though it does include human effects on the environment.\n[\n29\n]\nMethodology\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section\ndoes not\ncite\nany\nsources\n.\nPlease help\nimprove this section\nby\nadding citations to reliable sources\n.

Studies typically fall into one of three categories: observational, experimental, or theoretical. Earth scientists often conduct sophisticated computer analysis or visit an interesting location to study earth phenomena (e.g. Antarctica or\nhot spot\nisland chains).\nA foundational idea in Earth science is the notion of\nuniformitarianism\n, which states that \"ancient geologic features are interpreted by understanding active processes that are readily observed.\" In other words, any geologic processes at work in the present have operated in the same ways throughout geologic time. This enables those who study\nEarth history\nto apply knowledge of how the Earth's processes operate in the present to gain insight into how the planet has evolved and changed throughout long history.\nEarth's spheres\n[\nedit\n]\nNature timeline\nThis box:\nview\ntalk\nedit\n−13 —\n–\n−12 —\n–\n−11 —\n–\n−10 —\n–\n−9 —\n–\n−8 —\n–\n−7 —\n–\n−6 —\n–\n−5 —\n–\n−4 —\n–\n−3 —\n–\n−2 —\n–\n−1 —\n–\n0 —\nDark Ages\nReionization\nMatter-dominated\nera\nWater on Earth\nLife\nMulticellular\nlife\nVertebrates\n←\nEarliest stars\n←\nEarliest galaxy\n←\nEarliest\nquasar\n/\nblack hole\n←\nOmega Centauri\n←\nAndromeda Galaxy\n←\nMilky Way spirals\n←\nNGC 188 star cluster\n←\nAlpha Centauri\n←\nAccelerated expansion\n←\nEarth\n/\nSolar System\n←\nEarliest known life\n←\nAtmospheric oxygen\n←\nSexual reproduction\n←\nEarliest fungi\n←\nEarliest land plants\n←\nCambrian explosion\n←\nEarliest mammals\n←\nEarliest apes\n/\nhumans\n(\nbillion years ago\n)\nIn Earth science, it is common to conceptualize the Earth's surface as consisting of several distinct layers, often referred to as spheres: the\nlithosphere\n, the\nhydrosphere\n, the\natmosphere\n, and the\nbiosphere\n, this concept of spheres is a useful tool for understanding the Earth's surface and its various processes\n[\n30\n]\nthese correspond to\nrocks\n,\nwater\n,\nair\nand\nlife\n.

It is a broad\nnatural science\nthat encompasses a wide range of fields and unifying principles that explain the structure, function, growth,\norigin\n,\nevolution\n, and distribution of life. Central to biology are five fundamental themes: the\ncell\nas the basic unit of life,\ngenes\nand\nheredity\nas the basis of inheritance, evolution as the driver of\nbiological diversity\n,\nenergy\ntransformation for sustaining life processes, and the maintenance of internal stability (\nhomeostasis\n).\n[\n1\n]\n[\n2\n]\nBiology examines life across multiple\nlevels of organization\n, from\nmolecules\nand cells to organisms,\npopulations\n, and\necosystems\n. Subdisciplines include\nmolecular biology\n,\nphysiology\n,\necology\n,\nevolutionary biology\n,\ndevelopmental biology\n, and\nsystematics\n, among others. Each of these fields applies a range of methods to investigate biological phenomena, including\nobservation, experimentation\n, and\nmathematical modeling\n. Modern biology is grounded in the theory of evolution by\nnatural selection\n, first articulated by\nCharles Darwin\n, and in the molecular understanding of genes encoded in\nDNA\n. The discovery of the\nstructure of DNA\nand advances in\nmolecular genetics\nhave transformed many areas of biology, leading to applications in\nmedicine\n,\nagriculture\n,\nbiotechnology\n, and\nenvironmental science\n.\nLife on\nEarth\nis believed to have originated over 3.7 billion years ago.\n[\n3\n]\nToday, it includes a vast diversity of organisms—from single-celled\narchaea\nand\nbacteria\nto complex multicellular\nplants\n,\nfungi\n, and\nanimals\n.\nBiologists\nclassify organisms based on shared characteristics and evolutionary relationships, using\ntaxonomic\nand\nphylogenetic\nframeworks. These organisms interact with each other and with their environments in ecosystems, where they play roles in\nenergy flow\nand\nnutrient cycling\n. As a constantly evolving field, biology incorporates new discoveries and technologies that enhance the understanding of life and its processes, while contributing to solutions for challenges such as\ndisease\n,\nclimate change\n, and\nbiodiversity loss\n.\nEtymology\nFrom\nGreek\nβίος\n(\nbíos\n) 'life', (from\nProto-Indo-European\nroot *gwei-, to live) and\nλογία\n(\nlogia\n) 'study of'. The compound appears in the title of Volume 3 of\nMichael Christoph Hanow\n's\nPhilosophiae naturalis sive physicae dogmaticae: Geologia, biologia, phytologia generalis et dendrologia\n, published in 1766. The term\nbiology\nin its modern sense appears to have been introduced independently by\nThomas Beddoes\n(in 1799),\n[\n4\n]\nKarl Friedrich Burdach\n(in 1800),\nGottfried Reinhold Treviranus\n(\nBiologie oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur\n, 1802) and\nJean-Baptiste Lamarck\n(\nHydrogéologie\n, 1802).\n[\n5\n]\n[\n6\n]\n[\n7\n]\nHistory\nMain article:\nHistory of biology\nDrawing of what now are called\nSchwann cells\nby one of the founders of\ncell theory\n,\nTheodor Schwann\n.\nThe earliest of roots of science, which included medicine, can be traced to\nancient Egypt\nand\nMesopotamia\nin around 3000 to 1200\nBCE\n.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\nTheir contributions shaped ancient Greek\nnatural philosophy\n.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\nAncient Greek\nphilosophers such as\nAristotle\n(384–322 BCE) contributed extensively to the development of biological knowledge.\n[\n13\n]\nHe explored biological causation and the diversity of life. His successor,\nTheophrastus\n, began the scientific study of plants.\n[\n14\n]\nScholars of the\nmedieval Islamic world\nwho wrote on biology included\nal-Jahiz\n(781–869),\nAl-Dīnawarī\n(828–896), who wrote on botany,\n[\n15\n]\nand\nRhazes\n(865–925) who wrote on\nanatomy\nand\nphysiology\n. Medicine was especially well studied by\nIslamic scholars\nworking in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nBiology began to quickly develop with\nAnton van Leeuwenhoek\n's dramatic improvement of the\nmicroscope\n. It was then that scholars discovered\nspermatozoa\n, bacteria,\ninfusoria\nand the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by\nJan Swammerdam\nled to new interest in\nentomology\nand helped to develop techniques of microscopic\ndissection\nand\nstaining\n.\n[\n16\n]\nAdvances in microscopy had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, biologists pointed to the central importance of the\ncell\n. In 1838,\nSchleiden\nand\nSchwann\nbegan promoting the now universal ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of life, although they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells, continuing to support\nspontaneous generation\n. However,\nRobert Remak\nand\nRudolf Virchow\nwere able to reify the third tenet, and by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets which consolidated into\ncell theory\n.\n[\n17\n]\n[\n18\n]\nMeanwhile, taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians.\nCarl Linnaeus\npublished a basic\ntaxonomy\nfor the natural world in 1735, and in the 1750s introduced\nscientific names\nfor all his species.\n[\n19\n]\nGeorges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon\n, treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of\ncommon descent\n.\n[\n20\n]\nIn 1842,\nCharles Darwin\npenned his first sketch of\nOn the Origin of Species\n.\n[\n21\n]\nSerious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of\nJean-Baptiste Lamarck\n, who presented a coherent theory of evolution.\n[\n22\n]\nThe British\nnaturalist\nCharles Darwin\n, combining the biogeographical approach of\nHumboldt\n, the uniformitarian geology of\nLyell\n,\nMalthus's\nwritings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations, forged a more successful evolutionary theory based on\nnatural selection\n; similar reasoning and evidence led\nAlfred Russel Wallace\nto independently reach the same conclusions.\n[\n23\n]\n[\n24\n]\nThe basis for modern genetics began with the work of\nGregor Mendel\nin 1865.\n[\n25\n]\nThis outlined the principles of biological inheritance.\n[\n26\n]\nHowever, the significance of his work was not realized until the early 20th century when evolution became a unified theory as the\nmodern synthesis\nreconciled Darwinian evolution with\nclassical genetics\n.\n[\n27\n]\nIn the 1940s and early 1950s, a\nseries of experiments\nby\nAlfred Hershey\nand\nMartha Chase\npointed to\nDNA\nas the component of\nchromosomes\nthat held the trait-carrying units that had become known as\ngenes\n. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as\nviruses\nand bacteria, along with the discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA by\nJames Watson\nand\nFrancis Crick\nin 1953, marked the transition to the era of\nmolecular genetics\n. From the 1950s onwards, biology has been vastly extended in the\nmolecular\ndomain. The\ngenetic code\nwas cracked by\nHar Gobind Khorana\n,\nRobert W. Holley\nand\nMarshall Warren Nirenberg\nafter DNA was understood to contain\ncodons\n. The\nHuman Genome Project\nwas launched in 1990 to map the human\ngenome\n.\n[\n28\n]\nChemical basis\nAtoms and molecules\nFurther information:\nChemistry\nAll organisms are made up of\nchemical elements\n;\n[\n29\n]\noxygen\n,\ncarbon\n,\nhydrogen\n, and\nnitrogen\naccount for most (96%) of the mass of all organisms, with\ncalcium\n,\nphosphorus\n,\nsulfur\n,\nsodium\n,\nchlorine\n, and\nmagnesium\nconstituting essentially all the remainder. Different elements can combine to form\ncompounds\nsuch as water, which is fundamental to life.\n[\n29\n]\nBiochemistry\nis the study of\nchemical processes\nwithin and relating to living\norganisms\n.\nMolecular biology\nis the branch of biology that seeks to understand the molecular basis of biological activity in and between cells, including\nmolecular\nsynthesis, modification, mechanisms, and interactions.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nWater\nSee also:\nPlanetary habitability\n,\nCircumstellar habitable zone\n, and\nWater distribution on Earth\nModel of hydrogen bonds (1) between molecules of\nwater\nLife arose from the Earth's first ocean, which formed some 3.8 billion years ago.\n[\n30\n]\nSince then, water continues to be the most abundant molecule in every organism. Water is important to life because it is an effective\nsolvent\n, capable of dissolving solutes such as sodium and\nchloride\nions or other small molecules to form an\naqueous\nsolution\n. Once dissolved in water, these solutes are more likely to come in contact with one another and therefore take part in\nchemical reactions\nthat sustain life.\n[\n30\n]\nIn terms of its\nmolecular structure\n, water is a small\npolar molecule\nwith a bent shape formed by the polar covalent bonds of two hydrogen (H) atoms to one oxygen (O) atom (H\n2\nO).\n[\n30\n]\nBecause the O–H bonds are polar, the oxygen atom has a slight negative charge and the two hydrogen atoms have a slight positive charge.\n[\n30\n]\nThis polar\nproperty\nof water allows it to attract other water molecules via hydrogen bonds, which makes water\ncohesive\n.\n[\n30\n]\nSurface tension\nresults from the cohesive force due to the attraction between molecules at the surface of the liquid.\n[\n30\n]\nWater is also\nadhesive\nas it is able to adhere to the surface of any polar or charged non-water molecules.\n[\n30\n]\nWater is\ndenser\nas a\nliquid\nthan it is as a solid (or ice).\n[\n30\n]\nThis unique property of water allows ice to float above liquid water such as ponds, lakes, and oceans, thereby\ninsulating\nthe liquid below from the cold air above.\n[\n30\n]\nWater has the capacity to absorb energy, giving it a higher\nspecific heat capacity\nthan other solvents such as\nethanol\n.\n[\n30\n]\nThus, a large amount of energy is needed to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules to convert liquid water into\nwater vapor\n.\n[\n30\n]\nAs a molecule, water is not completely stable as each water molecule continuously dissociates into hydrogen and\nhydroxyl\nions before reforming into a water molecule again.\n[\n30\n]\nIn\npure water\n, the number of hydrogen ions balances (or equals) the number of hydroxyl ions, resulting in a\npH\nthat is neutral.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nOrganic compounds\nFurther information:\nOrganic chemistry\nOrganic compounds such as\nglucose\nare vital to organisms.\nOrganic compounds\nare molecules that contain carbon bonded to another element such as hydrogen.\n[\n30\n]\nWith the exception of water, nearly all the molecules that make up each organism contain carbon.\n[\n30\n]\n[\n31\n]\nCarbon can form\ncovalent bonds\nwith up to four other atoms, enabling it to form diverse, large, and complex molecules.\n[\n30\n]\n[\n31\n]\nFor example, a single carbon atom can form four single covalent bonds such as in\nmethane\n, two\ndouble covalent bonds\nsuch as in\ncarbon dioxide\n(CO\n2\n), or a\ntriple covalent bond\nsuch as in\ncarbon monoxide\n(CO). Moreover, carbon can form very long chains of interconnecting\ncarbon–carbon bonds\nsuch as\noctane\nor ring-like structures such as\nglucose\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe simplest form of an organic molecule is the\nhydrocarbon\n, which is a large family of organic compounds that are composed of hydrogen atoms bonded to a chain of carbon atoms. A hydrocarbon backbone can be substituted by other elements such as oxygen (O), hydrogen (H), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S), which can change the chemical behavior of that compound.\n[\n30\n]\nGroups of atoms that contain these elements (O-, H-, P-, and S-) and are bonded to a central carbon atom or skeleton are called\nfunctional groups\n.\n[\n30\n]\nThere are six prominent functional groups that can be found in organisms:\namino group\n,\ncarboxyl group\n,\ncarbonyl group\n,\nhydroxyl group\n,\nphosphate group\n, and\nsulfhydryl group\n.\n[\n30\n]\nIn 1953, the\nMiller–Urey experiment\nshowed that organic compounds could be synthesized abiotically within a closed system mimicking the conditions of\nearly Earth\n, thus suggesting that complex organic molecules could have arisen spontaneously in early Earth (see\nabiogenesis\n).\n[\n32\n]\n[\n30\n]\nMacromolecules\nMain article:\nMacromolecule\nThe (a) primary, (b) secondary, (c) tertiary, and (d) quaternary structures of a\nhemoglobin\nprotein\nMacromolecules\nare large molecules made up of smaller subunits or\nmonomers\n.\n[\n33\n]\nMonomers include sugars, amino acids, and nucleotides.\n[\n34\n]\nCarbohydrates\ninclude monomers and polymers of sugars.\n[\n35\n]\nLipids are the only class of macromolecules that are not made up of polymers. They include\nsteroids\n,\nphospholipids\n, and fats,\n[\n34\n]\nlargely nonpolar and hydrophobic (water-repelling) substances.\n[\n36\n]\nProteins are the most diverse of the macromolecules. They include\nenzymes\n,\ntransport proteins\n, large\nsignaling\nmolecules,\nantibodies\n, and\nstructural proteins\n. The basic unit (or monomer) of a protein is an\namino acid\n.\n[\n33\n]\nTwenty amino acids are used in proteins.\n[\n33\n]\nNucleic acids are polymers of\nnucleotides\n.\n[\n37\n]\nTheir function is to store, transmit, and express hereditary information.\n[\n34\n]\nCells\nMain article:\nCell (biology)\nCell theory\nstates that\ncells\nare the fundamental units of life, that all living things are composed of one or more cells, and that all cells arise from preexisting cells through\ncell division\n.\n[\n38\n]\nMost cells are very small, with diameters ranging from 1 to 100\nmicrometers\nand are therefore only visible under a\nlight\nor\nelectron microscope\n.\n[\n39\n]\nThere are generally two types of cells:\neukaryotic\ncells, which contain a\nnucleus\n, and\nprokaryotic\ncells, which do not. Prokaryotes are\nsingle-celled organisms\nsuch as\nbacteria\n, whereas eukaryotes can be single-celled or multicellular. In\nmulticellular organisms\n, every cell in the organism's body is derived ultimately from a\nsingle cell\nin a fertilized\negg\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nCell structure\nStructure of an animal\ncell\ndepicting various\norganelles\nEvery cell is enclosed within a\ncell membrane\nthat separates its\ncytoplasm\nfrom the\nextracellular space\n.\n[\n40\n]\nA cell membrane consists of a\nlipid bilayer\n, including\ncholesterols\nthat sit between phospholipids to maintain their\nfluidity\nat various temperatures. Cell membranes are\nsemipermeable\n, allowing small molecules such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water to pass through while restricting the movement of larger molecules and charged particles such as\nions\n.\n[\n41\n]\nCell membranes also contain\nmembrane proteins\n, including\nintegral membrane proteins\nthat go across the membrane serving as\nmembrane transporters\n, and\nperipheral proteins\nthat loosely attach to the outer side of the cell membrane, acting as enzymes shaping the cell.\n[\n42\n]\nCell membranes are involved in various cellular processes such as\ncell adhesion\n,\nstoring electrical energy\n, and\ncell signalling\nand serve as the attachment surface for several extracellular structures such as a\ncell wall\n,\nglycocalyx\n, and\ncytoskeleton\n.\nStructure of a plant cell\nWithin the cytoplasm of a cell, there are many biomolecules such as\nproteins\nand\nnucleic acids\n.\n[\n43\n]\nIn addition to biomolecules, eukaryotic cells have specialized structures called\norganelles\nthat have their own lipid bilayers or are spatially units.\n[\n44\n]\nThese organelles include the\ncell nucleus\n, which contains most of the cell's DNA, or\nmitochondria\n, which generate\nadenosine triphosphate\n(ATP) to power cellular processes. Other organelles such as\nendoplasmic reticulum\nand\nGolgi apparatus\nplay a role in the synthesis and packaging of proteins, respectively. Biomolecules such as proteins can be engulfed by\nlysosomes\n, another specialized organelle.\nPlant cells\nhave additional organelles that distinguish them from\nanimal cells\nsuch as a cell wall that provides support for the plant cell,\nchloroplasts\nthat harvest sunlight energy to produce sugar, and\nvacuoles\nthat provide storage and structural support as well as being involved in reproduction and breakdown of plant seeds.\n[\n44\n]\nEukaryotic cells also have cytoskeleton that is made up of\nmicrotubules\n,\nintermediate filaments\n, and\nmicrofilaments\n, all of which provide support for the cell and are involved in the movement of the cell and its organelles.\n[\n44\n]\nIn terms of their structural composition, the microtubules are made up of\ntubulin\n(e.g.,\nα-tubulin\nand\nβ-tubulin\n) whereas intermediate filaments are made up of fibrous proteins.\n[\n44\n]\nMicrofilaments are made up of\nactin\nmolecules that interact with other strands of proteins.\n[\n44\n]\nMetabolism\nFurther information:\nBioenergetics\nExample of an enzyme-catalysed\nexothermic\nreaction\nAll cells require energy to sustain cellular processes.\nMetabolism\nis the set of\nchemical reactions\nin an organism. The three main purposes of metabolism are: the conversion of food to energy to run cellular processes; the conversion of food/fuel to monomer building blocks; and the elimination of\nmetabolic wastes\n. These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. Metabolic reactions may be categorized as\ncatabolic\n—the breaking down of compounds (for example, the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate by\ncellular respiration\n); or\nanabolic\n—the building up (\nsynthesis\n) of compounds (such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids). Usually, catabolism releases energy, and anabolism consumes energy. The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into\nmetabolic pathways\n, in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical, each step being facilitated by a specific enzyme. Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy that will not occur by themselves, by\ncoupling\nthem to\nspontaneous reactions\nthat release energy. Enzymes act as\ncatalysts\n—they allow a reaction to proceed more rapidly without being consumed by it—by reducing the amount of\nactivation energy\nneeded to convert\nreactants\ninto\nproducts\n. Enzymes also allow the\nregulation\nof the rate of a metabolic reaction, for example in response to changes in the cell's environment or to signals from other cells.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nCellular respiration\nMain article:\nCellular respiration\nRespiration in a\neukaryotic cell\nCellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in cells to convert\nchemical energy\nfrom\nnutrients\ninto adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products.\n[\n45\n]\nThe reactions involved in respiration are\ncatabolic reactions\n, which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy. Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are\nredox\nreactions. Although cellular respiration is technically a\ncombustion reaction\n, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a cell because of the slow, controlled release of energy from the series of reactions.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nSugar in the form of glucose is the main nutrient used by animal and plant cells in respiration. Cellular respiration involving oxygen is called aerobic respiration, which has four stages:\nglycolysis\n,\ncitric acid cycle\n(or Krebs cycle),\nelectron transport chain\n, and\noxidative phosphorylation\n.\n[\n46\n]\nGlycolysis is a metabolic process that occurs in the cytoplasm whereby glucose is converted into two\npyruvates\n, with two net molecules of ATP being produced at the same time.\n[\n46\n]\nEach pyruvate is then oxidized into\nacetyl-CoA\nby the\npyruvate dehydrogenase complex\n, which also generates\nNADH\nand carbon dioxide. Acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle, which takes places inside the mitochondrial matrix. At the end of the cycle, the total yield from 1 glucose (or 2 pyruvates) is 6 NADH, 2 FADH\n2\n, and 2 ATP molecules. Finally, the next stage is oxidative phosphorylation, which in eukaryotes, occurs in the\nmitochondrial cristae\n. Oxidative phosphorylation comprises the electron transport chain, which is a series of four\nprotein complexes\nthat transfer electrons from one complex to another, thereby releasing energy from NADH and FADH\n2\nthat is coupled to the pumping of protons (hydrogen ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane (\nchemiosmosis\n), which generates a\nproton motive force\n.\n[\n46\n]\nEnergy from the proton motive force drives the enzyme\nATP synthase\nto synthesize more ATPs by\nphosphorylating\nADPs\n. The transfer of electrons terminates with molecular oxygen being the final\nelectron acceptor\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nIf oxygen were not present, pyruvate would not be metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of\nfermentation\n. The pyruvate is not transported into the mitochondrion but remains in the cytoplasm, where it is converted to\nwaste products\nthat may be removed from the cell. This serves the purpose of oxidizing the electron carriers so that they can perform glycolysis again and removing the excess pyruvate. Fermentation oxidizes NADH to NAD\n+\nso it can be re-used in glycolysis. In the absence of oxygen, fermentation prevents the buildup of NADH in the cytoplasm and provides NAD\n+\nfor glycolysis. This waste product varies depending on the organism. In skeletal muscles, the waste product is\nlactic acid\n. This type of fermentation is called\nlactic acid fermentation\n. In strenuous exercise, when energy demands exceed energy supply, the respiratory chain cannot process all of the hydrogen atoms joined by NADH. During anaerobic glycolysis, NAD\n+\nregenerates when pairs of hydrogen combine with pyruvate to form lactate. Lactate formation is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in a reversible reaction. Lactate can also be used as an indirect precursor for liver glycogen. During recovery, when oxygen becomes available, NAD\n+\nattaches to hydrogen from lactate to form ATP. In yeast, the waste products are ethanol and carbon dioxide. This type of fermentation is known as alcoholic or\nethanol fermentation\n. The ATP generated in this process is made by\nsubstrate-level phosphorylation\n, which does not require oxygen.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nPhotosynthesis\nMain article:\nPhotosynthesis\nPhotosynthesis changes sunlight into chemical energy, splits water to liberate O\n2\n, and fixes CO\n2\ninto sugar.\nPhotosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to\nconvert\nlight energy\ninto\nchemical energy\nthat can later be released to fuel the organism's metabolic activities via cellular respiration. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water.\n[\n47\n]\n[\n48\n]\n[\n49\n]\nIn most cases, oxygen is released as a waste product. Most plants,\nalgae\n, and\ncyanobacteria\nperform photosynthesis, which is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the\noxygen content\nof the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.\n[\n50\n]\nPhotosynthesis has four stages:\nLight absorption\n, electron transport, ATP synthesis, and\ncarbon fixation\n.\n[\n46\n]\nLight absorption is the initial step of photosynthesis whereby light energy is absorbed by\nchlorophyll\npigments attached to proteins in the\nthylakoid membranes\n. The absorbed light energy is used to remove electrons from a donor (water) to a primary electron acceptor, a\nquinone\ndesignated as Q. In the second stage, electrons move from the quinone primary electron acceptor through a series of electron carriers until they reach a final electron acceptor, which is usually the oxidized form of NADP\n+\n, which is reduced to NADPH, a process that takes place in a protein complex called\nphotosystem I\n(PSI). The transport of electrons is coupled to the movement of protons (or hydrogen) from the stroma to the thylakoid membrane, which forms a pH gradient across the membrane as hydrogen becomes more concentrated in the lumen than in the stroma. This is analogous to the proton-motive force generated across the inner mitochondrial membrane in aerobic respiration.\n[\n46\n]\nDuring the third stage of photosynthesis, the movement of protons down their\nconcentration gradients\nfrom the thylakoid lumen to the stroma through the ATP synthase is coupled to the synthesis of ATP by that same ATP synthase.\n[\n46\n]\nThe NADPH and ATPs generated by the\nlight-dependent reactions\nin the second and third stages, respectively, provide the energy and electrons to drive the synthesis of glucose by fixing atmospheric carbon dioxide into existing organic carbon compounds, such as\nribulose bisphosphate\n(RuBP) in a sequence of light-independent (or dark) reactions called the\nCalvin cycle\n.\n[\n51\n]\nCell signaling\nMain article:\nCell signaling\nCell signaling (or communication) is the ability of\ncells\nto receive, process, and transmit signals with its environment and with itself.\n[\n52\n]\n[\n53\n]\nSignals can be non-chemical such as light,\nelectrical impulses\n, and heat, or chemical signals (or\nligands\n) that interact with\nreceptors\n, which can be found\nembedded\nin the\ncell membrane\nof another cell or\nlocated deep inside\na cell.\n[\n54\n]\n[\n53\n]\nThere are generally four types of chemical signals:\nautocrine\n,\nparacrine\n,\njuxtacrine\n, and\nhormones\n.\n[\n54\n]\nIn autocrine signaling, the ligand affects the same cell that releases it.\nTumor\ncells, for example, can reproduce uncontrollably because they release signals that initiate their own self-division. In paracrine signaling, the ligand diffuses to nearby cells and affects them. For example, brain cells called\nneurons\nrelease ligands called\nneurotransmitters\nthat diffuse across a\nsynaptic cleft\nto bind with a receptor on an adjacent cell such as another neuron or\nmuscle cell\n. In juxtacrine signaling, there is direct contact between the signaling and responding cells. Finally, hormones are ligands that travel through the\ncirculatory systems\nof animals or\nvascular systems\nof plants to reach their target cells. Once a ligand binds with a receptor, it can influence the behavior of another cell, depending on the type of receptor. For instance, neurotransmitters that bind with an\nionotropic receptor\ncan alter the\nexcitability\nof a target cell. Other types of receptors include\nprotein kinase\nreceptors (e.g.,\nreceptor\nfor the hormone\ninsulin\n) and\nG protein-coupled receptors\n. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors can initiate\nsecond messenger\ncascades. The process by which a chemical or physical signal is transmitted through a cell as a\nseries of molecular events\nis called\nsignal transduction\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nCell cycle\nMain article:\nCell cycle\nA diagram of the mitotic phases\nThe cell cycle is a series of events that take place in a\ncell\nthat cause it to divide into two daughter cells. These events include the\nduplication of its DNA\nand some of its\norganelles\n, and the subsequent partitioning of its cytoplasm into two daughter cells in a process called\ncell division\n.\n[\n55\n]\nIn\neukaryotes\n(i.e., animal, plant,\nfungal\n, and\nprotist\ncells), there are two distinct types of cell division:\nmitosis\nand\nmeiosis\n.\n[\n56\n]\nMitosis is part of the cell cycle, in which replicated\nchromosomes\nare separated into two new nuclei. Cell division gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the total number of chromosomes is maintained. In general, mitosis (division of the nucleus) is preceded by the S stage of\ninterphase\n(during which the DNA is replicated) and is often followed by\ntelophase\nand\ncytokinesis\n; which divides the\ncytoplasm\n,\norganelles\nand\ncell membrane\nof one cell into two new\ncells\ncontaining roughly equal shares of these cellular components. The different stages of mitosis all together define the mitotic phase of an animal cell cycle—the division of the mother cell into two genetically identical daughter cells.\n[\n57\n]\nThe cell cycle is a vital process by which a single-celled\nfertilized egg\ndevelops into a mature organism, as well as the process by which hair, skin,\nblood cells\n, and some\ninternal organs\nare renewed. After cell division, each of the daughter cells begin the\ninterphase\nof a new cycle. In contrast to mitosis, meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions.\n[\n58\n]\nHomologous chromosomes\nare separated in the first division (\nmeiosis I\n), and sister chromatids are separated in the second division (\nmeiosis II\n). Both of these cell division cycles are used in the process of sexual reproduction at some point in their life cycle. Both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nIn meiosis, the chromosomes duplicate and the\nhomologous chromosomes\nexchange genetic information during meiosis I. The daughter cells divide again in meiosis II to form haploid\ngametes\n.\nProkaryotes\n(i.e.,\narchaea\nand bacteria) can also undergo cell division (or\nbinary fission\n). Unlike the processes of\nmitosis\nand\nmeiosis\nin eukaryotes, binary fission in prokaryotes takes place without the formation of a\nspindle apparatus\non the cell. Before binary fission, DNA in the bacterium is tightly coiled. After it has uncoiled and duplicated, it is pulled to the separate poles of the bacterium as it increases the size to prepare for splitting. Growth of a new cell wall begins to separate the bacterium (triggered by\nFtsZ\npolymerization and \"Z-ring\" formation).\n[\n59\n]\nThe new cell wall (\nseptum\n) fully develops, resulting in the complete split of the bacterium. The new daughter cells have tightly coiled DNA rods,\nribosomes\n, and\nplasmids\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nSexual reproduction and meiosis\nMeiosis is a central feature of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes, and the most fundamental function of\nmeiosis\nappears to be conservation of the integrity of the\ngenome\nthat is passed on to progeny by parents.\n[\n60\n]\n[\n61\n]\nTwo aspects of\nsexual reproduction\n,\nmeiotic recombination\nand\noutcrossing\n, are likely maintained respectively by the adaptive advantages of recombinational repair of genomic\nDNA damage\nand genetic\ncomplementation\nwhich masks the expression of deleterious recessive\nmutations\n.\n[\n62\n]\nThe beneficial effect of genetic complementation, derived from outcrossing (cross-fertilization) is also referred to as hybrid vigor or heterosis. Charles Darwin in his 1878 book\nThe Effects of Cross and Self-Fertilization in the Vegetable Kingdom\n[\n63\n]\nat the start of chapter XII noted \"The first and most important of the conclusions which may be drawn from the observations given in this volume, is that generally cross-fertilisation is beneficial and self-fertilisation often injurious, at least with the plants on which I experimented.\"\nGenetic variation\n, often produced as a byproduct of sexual reproduction, may provide long-term advantages to those sexual lineages that engage in\noutcrossing\n.\n[\n62\n]\nGenetics\nInheritance\nMain article:\nClassical genetics\nPunnett square\ndepicting a cross between two pea plants heterozygous for purple (B) and white (b) blossoms\nGenetics\nis the scientific study of inheritance.\n[\n64\n]\n[\n65\n]\n[\n66\n]\nMendelian inheritance\n, specifically, is the process by which genes and traits are passed on from parents to offspring.\n[\n26\n]\nIt has several principles. The first is that genetic characteristics,\nalleles\n, are discrete and have alternate forms (e.g., purple vs. white or tall vs. dwarf), each inherited from one of two parents. Based on the\nlaw of dominance and uniformity\n, which states that some alleles are\ndominant\nwhile others are\nrecessive\n; an organism with at least one dominant allele will display the\nphenotype\nof that dominant allele. During gamete formation, the alleles for each gene segregate, so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene.\nHeterozygotic\nindividuals produce gametes with an equal frequency of two alleles. Finally, the\nlaw of independent assortment\n, states that genes of different traits can segregate independently during the formation of gametes, i.e., genes are unlinked. An exception to this rule would include traits that are\nsex-linked\n.\nTest crosses\ncan be performed to experimentally determine the underlying\ngenotype\nof an organism with a dominant phenotype.\n[\n67\n]\nA\nPunnett square\ncan be used to predict the results of a test cross. The\nchromosome theory of inheritance\n, which states that genes are found on chromosomes, was supported by\nThomas Morgans\n's experiments with\nfruit flies\n, which established the\nsex linkage\nbetween eye color and sex in these insects.\n[\n68\n]\nGenes and DNA\nFurther information:\nGene\nand\nDNA\nBases lie between two spiraling DNA strands.\nA gene is a unit of\nheredity\nthat corresponds to a region of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that carries genetic information that controls form or function of an organism. DNA is composed of two\npolynucleotide\nchains that coil around each other to form a\ndouble helix\n.\n[\n69\n]\nIt is found as linear\nchromosomes\nin\neukaryotes\n, and circular chromosomes in\nprokaryotes\n. The set of chromosomes in a cell is collectively known as its\ngenome\n. In eukaryotes, DNA is mainly in the\ncell nucleus\n.\n[\n70\n]\nIn prokaryotes, the DNA is held within the\nnucleoid\n.\n[\n71\n]\nThe genetic information is held within genes, and the complete assemblage in an organism is called its\ngenotype\n.\n[\n72\n]\nDNA replication\nis a\nsemiconservative\nprocess whereby each strand serves as a template for a new strand of DNA.\n[\n69\n]\nMutations are heritable changes in DNA.\n[\n69\n]\nThey can arise\nspontaneously\nas a result of replication errors that were not corrected by proofreading or can be\ninduced\nby an environmental\nmutagen\nsuch as a chemical (e.g.,\nnitrous acid\n,\nbenzopyrene\n) or radiation (e.g.,\nx-ray\n,\ngamma ray\n,\nultraviolet radiation\n, particles emitted by unstable isotopes).\n[\n69\n]\nMutations can lead to phenotypic effects such as loss-of-function,\ngain-of-function\n, and conditional mutations.\n[\n69\n]\nSome mutations are beneficial, as they are a source of\ngenetic variation\nfor evolution.\n[\n69\n]\nOthers are harmful if they were to result in a loss of function of genes needed for survival.\n[\n69\n]\nGene expression\nThe extended\ncentral dogma of molecular biology\nincludes all the processes involved in the flow of genetic information.\nMain article:\nGene expression\nGene expression is the molecular process by which a\ngenotype\nencoded in DNA gives rise to an observable\nphenotype\nin the proteins of an organism's body. This process is summarized by the\ncentral dogma of molecular biology\n, which was formulated by\nFrancis Crick\nin 1958.\n[\n73\n]\n[\n74\n]\n[\n75\n]\nAccording to the Central Dogma, genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. There are two gene expression processes:\ntranscription\n(DNA to RNA) and\ntranslation\n(RNA to protein).\n[\n76\n]\nGene regulation\nMain article:\nRegulation of gene expression\nThe regulation of gene expression by environmental factors and during different stages of\ndevelopment\ncan occur at each step of the process such as\ntranscription\n,\nRNA splicing\n,\ntranslation\n, and\npost-translational modification\nof a protein.\n[\n77\n]\nGene expression can be influenced by positive or negative regulation, depending on which of the two types of regulatory proteins called\ntranscription factors\nbind to the DNA sequence close to or at a promoter.\n[\n77\n]\nA cluster of genes that share the same promoter is called an\noperon\n, found mainly in prokaryotes and some lower eukaryotes (e.g.,\nCaenorhabditis elegans\n).\n[\n77\n]\n[\n78\n]\nIn positive regulation of gene expression, the\nactivator\nis the transcription factor that stimulates transcription when it binds to the sequence near or at the promoter. Negative regulation occurs when another transcription factor called a\nrepressor\nbinds to a DNA sequence called an\noperator\n, which is part of an operon, to prevent transcription. Repressors can be inhibited by compounds called\ninducers\n(e.g.,\nallolactose\n), thereby allowing transcription to occur.\n[\n77\n]\nSpecific genes that can be activated by inducers are called\ninducible genes\n, in contrast to\nconstitutive genes\nthat are almost constantly active.\n[\n77\n]\nIn contrast to both,\nstructural genes\nencode proteins that are not involved in gene regulation.\n[\n77\n]\nIn addition to regulatory events involving the promoter, gene expression can also be regulated by\nepigenetic\nchanges to\nchromatin\n, which is a complex of DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cells.\n[\n77\n]\nGenes, development, and evolution\nMain article:\nEvolutionary developmental biology\nDevelopment\nis the process by which a\nmulticellular organism\n(plant or animal) goes through a series of changes, starting from a single cell, and taking on various forms that are characteristic of its life cycle.\n[\n79\n]\nThere are four key processes that underlie development:\nDetermination\n,\ndifferentiation\n,\nmorphogenesis\n, and growth. Determination sets the developmental fate of a cell, which becomes more restrictive during development. Differentiation is the process by which specialized cells arise from less specialized cells such as\nstem cells\n.\n[\n80\n]\n[\n81\n]\nStem cells are\nundifferentiated\nor partially differentiated\ncells\nthat can differentiate into various\ntypes of cells\nand\nproliferate\nindefinitely to produce more of the same stem cell.\n[\n82\n]\nCellular differentiation dramatically changes a cell's size, shape,\nmembrane potential\n,\nmetabolic activity\n, and responsiveness to signals, which are largely due to highly controlled modifications in\ngene expression\nand\nepigenetics\n. With a few exceptions, cellular differentiation almost never involves a change in the\nDNA\nsequence itself.\n[\n83\n]\nThus, different cells can have very different physical characteristics despite having the same\ngenome\n. Morphogenesis, or the development of body form, is the result of spatial differences in gene expression.\n[\n79\n]\nA small fraction of the genes in an organism's genome called the\ndevelopmental-genetic toolkit\ncontrol the development of that organism. These toolkit genes are highly conserved among\nphyla\n, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Among the most important toolkit genes are the\nHox\ngenes\n. Hox genes determine where repeating parts, such as the many\nvertebrae\nof snakes, will grow in a developing embryo or larva.\n[\n84\n]\nEvolution\nEvolutionary processes\nMain article:\nEvolutionary biology\nNatural selection\nfor darker traits\nEvolution\nis a central organizing concept in biology. It is the change in\nheritable\ncharacteristics\nof populations over successive\ngenerations\n.\n[\n85\n]\n[\n86\n]\nIn\nartificial selection\n, animals were selectively bred for specific traits.\n[\n87\n]\nGiven that traits are inherited, populations contain a varied mix of traits, and reproduction is able to increase any population, Darwin argued that in the natural world, it was nature that played the role of humans in selecting for specific traits.\n[\n87\n]\nDarwin inferred that individuals who possessed heritable traits better adapted to their environments are more likely to survive and produce more offspring than other individuals.\n[\n87\n]\nHe further inferred that this would lead to the accumulation of favorable traits over successive generations, thereby increasing the match between the organisms and their environment.\n[\n88\n]\n[\n89\n]\n[\n90\n]\n[\n87\n]\n[\n91\n]\nSpeciation\nMain article:\nSpeciation\nA species is a group of organisms that mate with one another and speciation is the process by which one lineage splits into two lineages as a result of having evolved independently from each other.\n[\n92\n]\nFor speciation to occur, there has to be\nreproductive isolation\n.\n[\n92\n]\nReproductive isolation can result from incompatibilities between genes as described by\nBateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model\n. Reproductive isolation also tends to increase with\ngenetic divergence\n. Speciation can occur when there are physical barriers that divide an ancestral species, a process known as\nallopatric speciation\n.\n[\n92\n]\nPhylogeny\nMain article:\nPhylogenetics\nPhylogenetic tree showing the domains of\nbacteria\n,\narchaea\n, and\neukaryotes\nA phylogeny is an evolutionary history of a specific group of organisms or their genes.\n[\n93\n]\nIt can be represented using a\nphylogenetic tree\n, a diagram showing lines of descent among organisms or their genes. Each line drawn on the time axis of a tree represents a\nlineage\nof descendants of a particular species or population. When a lineage divides into two, it is represented as a fork or split on the phylogenetic tree.\n[\n93\n]\nPhylogenetic trees are the basis for comparing and grouping different species.\n[\n93\n]\nDifferent species that share a feature inherited from a common ancestor are described as having\nhomologous\nfeatures (or\nsynapomorphy\n).\n[\n94\n]\n[\n95\n]\n[\n93\n]\nPhylogeny provides the basis of biological classification.\n[\n93\n]\nThis classification system is rank-based, with the highest rank being the\ndomain\nfollowed by\nkingdom\n,\nphylum\n,\nclass\n,\norder\n,\nfamily\n,\ngenus\n, and\nspecies\n.\n[\n93\n]\nAll organisms can be classified as belonging to one of\nthree domains\n: Archaea (originally Archaebacteria), Bacteria (originally eubacteria), or Eukarya (includes the fungi, plant, and animal kingdoms).\n[\n96\n]\nHistory of life\nMain article:\nHistory of life\nThe history of life on Earth traces how organisms have evolved from the earliest emergence of life to present day. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago and all life on Earth, both living and extinct, descended from a\nlast universal common ancestor\nthat lived about\n3.5 billion years ago\n.\n[\n97\n]\n[\n98\n]\nGeologists have developed a\ngeologic time scale\nthat divides the history of the Earth into major divisions, starting with four eons (\nHadean\n,\nArchean\n,\nProterozoic\n, and\nPhanerozoic\n), the first three of which are collectively known as the\nPrecambrian\n, which lasted approximately 4 billion years.\n[\n99\n]\nEach eon can be divided into eras, with the Phanerozoic eon that began 539 million years ago\n[\n100\n]\nbeing subdivided into\nPaleozoic\n,\nMesozoic\n, and\nCenozoic\neras.\n[\n99\n]\nThese three eras together comprise eleven\nperiods\n(\nCambrian\n,\nOrdovician\n,\nSilurian\n,\nDevonian\n,\nCarboniferous\n,\nPermian\n,\nTriassic\n,\nJurassic\n,\nCretaceous\n,\nTertiary\n, and\nQuaternary\n).\n[\n99\n]\nThe similarities among all known present-day\nspecies\nindicate that they have diverged through the process of\nevolution\nfrom their common ancestor.\n[\n101\n]\nBiologists regard the ubiquity of the\ngenetic code\nas evidence of universal\ncommon descent\nfor all\nbacteria\n,\narchaea\n, and\neukaryotes\n.\n[\n102\n]\n[\n3\n]\n[\n103\n]\n[\n104\n]\nMicrobial mats\nof coexisting bacteria and archaea were the dominant form of life in the early\nArchean\neon and many of the major steps in early evolution are thought to have taken place in this environment.\n[\n105\n]\nThe earliest evidence of\neukaryotes\ndates from 1.85 billion years ago,\n[\n106\n]\n[\n107\n]\nand while they may have been present earlier, their diversification accelerated when they started using oxygen in their\nmetabolism\n. Later, around 1.7 billion years ago,\nmulticellular organisms\nbegan to appear, with\ndifferentiated cells\nperforming specialised functions.\n[\n108\n]\nAlgae-like multicellular land plants are dated back to about 1 billion years ago,\n[\n109\n]\nalthough evidence suggests that\nmicroorganisms\nformed the earliest\nterrestrial ecosystems\n, at least 2.7 billion years ago.\n[\n110\n]\nMicroorganisms are thought to have paved the way for the inception of land plants in the\nOrdovician\nperiod. Land plants were so successful that they are thought to have contributed to the\nLate Devonian extinction event\n.\n[\n111\n]\nEdiacara biota\nappear during the\nEdiacaran\nperiod,\n[\n112\n]\nwhile\nvertebrates\n, along with most other modern\nphyla\noriginated about 525 million years ago during the\nCambrian explosion\n.\n[\n113\n]\nDuring the Permian period,\nsynapsids\n, including the ancestors of\nmammals\n, dominated the land,\n[\n114\n]\nbut most of this group became extinct in the\nPermian–Triassic extinction event\n252 million years ago.\n[\n115\n]\nDuring the recovery from this catastrophe,\narchosaurs\nbecame the most abundant land vertebrates;\n[\n116\n]\none archosaur group, the dinosaurs, dominated the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.\n[\n117\n]\nAfter the\nCretaceous–Paleogene extinction event\n66 million years ago killed off the non-avian dinosaurs,\n[\n118\n]\nmammals\nincreased rapidly in size and diversity\n.\n[\n119\n]\nSuch\nmass extinctions\nmay have accelerated evolution by providing opportunities for new groups of organisms to diversify.\n[\n120\n]\nDiversity\nBacteria and Archaea\nFurther information:\nMicrobiology\nBacteria –\nGemmatimonas aurantiaca\n(-=1 Micrometer)\nArchaea\n–\nHaloarchaea\nBacteria are a type of\ncell\nthat constitute a large\ndomain\nof\nprokaryotic\nmicroorganisms\n. Typically a few\nmicrometers\nin length, bacteria have a\nnumber of shapes\n, ranging from\nspheres\nto\nrods\nand\nspirals\n. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its\nhabitats\n. Bacteria inhabit soil, water,\nacidic hot springs\n,\nradioactive waste\n,\n[\n121\n]\nand the\ndeep biosphere\nof the\nEarth's crust\n. Bacteria also live in\nsymbiotic\nand\nparasitic\nrelationships with plants and animals. Most bacteria have not been characterised, and only about 27 percent of the\nbacterial phyla\nhave species that can be\ngrown\nin the laboratory.\n[\n122\n]\nArchaea\nconstitute the other domain of prokaryotic cells and were initially\nclassified\nas bacteria, receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria\nkingdom\n), a term that has fallen out of use.\n[\n123\n]\nArchaeal cells have unique properties separating them from the other\ntwo domains\n, Bacteria and\nEukaryota\n. Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized\nphyla\n. Archaea and bacteria are generally similar in size and shape, although a few archaea have very different shapes, such as the flat and square cells of\nHaloquadratum walsbyi\n.\n[\n124\n]\nDespite this\nmorphological\nsimilarity to bacteria, archaea possess\ngenes\nand several\nmetabolic pathways\nthat are more closely related to those of eukaryotes, notably for the\nenzymes\ninvolved in\ntranscription\nand\ntranslation\n. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on\nether lipids\nin their\ncell membranes\n,\n[\n125\n]\nincluding\narchaeols\n. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from\norganic compounds\n, such as sugars, to\nammonia\n,\nmetal ions\nor even\nhydrogen gas\n.\nSalt-tolerant\narchaea (the\nHaloarchaea\n) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea\nfix carbon\n, but unlike plants and\ncyanobacteria\n, no known species of archaea does both. Archaea\nreproduce asexually\nby\nbinary fission\n,\nfragmentation\n, or\nbudding\n; unlike bacteria, no known species of Archaea form\nendospores\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe first observed archaea were\nextremophiles\n, living in extreme environments, such as\nhot springs\nand\nsalt lakes\nwith no other organisms. Improved molecular detection tools led to the discovery of archaea in almost every\nhabitat\n, including soil, oceans, and\nmarshlands\n. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in\nplankton\nmay be one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nArchaea are a major part of\nEarth's life\n. They are part of the\nmicrobiota\nof all organisms. In the\nhuman microbiome\n, they are important in the\ngut\n, mouth, and on the skin.\n[\n126\n]\nTheir morphological, metabolic, and geographical diversity permits them to play multiple ecological roles: carbon fixation; nitrogen cycling; organic compound turnover; and maintaining microbial symbiotic and\nsyntrophic\ncommunities, for example.\n[\n127\n]\nEukaryotes\nMain article:\nEukaryote\nEuglena\n, a single-celled eukaryote that can both move and photosynthesize\nEukaryotes are hypothesized to have split from archaea, which was followed by their\nendosymbioses\nwith bacteria (or\nsymbiogenesis\n) that gave rise to mitochondria and chloroplasts, both of which are now part of modern-day eukaryotic cells.\n[\n128\n]\nThe major lineages of eukaryotes diversified in the\nPrecambrian\nabout 1.5 billion years ago and can be classified into eight major\nclades\n:\nalveolates\n,\nexcavates\n,\nstramenopiles\n, plants,\nrhizarians\n,\namoebozoans\n,\nfungi\n, and animals.\n[\n128\n]\nFive of these clades are collectively known as\nprotists\n, which are mostly microscopic\neukaryotic\norganisms that are not plants, fungi, or animals.\n[\n128\n]\nWhile it is likely that protists share a\ncommon ancestor\n(the\nlast eukaryotic common ancestor\n),\n[\n129\n]\nprotists by themselves do not constitute a separate clade as some protists may be more closely related to plants, fungi, or animals than they are to other protists. Like groupings such as\nalgae\n,\ninvertebrates\n, or\nprotozoans\n, the protist grouping is not a formal taxonomic group but is used for convenience.\n[\n128\n]\n[\n130\n]\nMost protists are unicellular; these are called microbial eukaryotes.\n[\n128\n]\nPlants are mainly multicellular\norganisms\n, predominantly\nphotosynthetic\neukaryotes of the\nkingdom\nPlantae, which would exclude fungi and some\nalgae\n. Plant cells were derived by endosymbiosis of a\ncyanobacterium\ninto an early eukaryote about one billion years ago, which gave rise to chloroplasts.\n[\n131\n]\nThe first several clades that emerged following primary endosymbiosis were aquatic and most of the aquatic photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms are collectively described as algae, which is a term of convenience as not all algae are closely related.\n[\n131\n]\nAlgae comprise several distinct clades such as\nglaucophytes\n, which are microscopic freshwater algae that may have resembled in form to the early unicellular ancestor of Plantae.\n[\n131\n]\nUnlike glaucophytes, the other algal clades such as\nred\nand\ngreen algae\nare multicellular. Green algae comprise three major clades:\nchlorophytes\n,\ncoleochaetophytes\n, and\nstoneworts\n.\n[\n131\n]\nFungi\nare eukaryotes that digest foods outside their bodies,\n[\n132\n]\nsecreting digestive enzymes that break down large food molecules before absorbing them through their cell membranes. Many fungi are also\nsaprobes\n, feeding on dead organic matter, making them important\ndecomposers\nin ecological systems.\n[\n132\n]\nAnimals are multicellular eukaryotes. With few exceptions, animals\nconsume organic material\n,\nbreathe oxygen\n, are\nable to move\n, can\nreproduce sexually\n, and grow from a hollow sphere of\ncells\n, the\nblastula\n, during\nembryonic development\n. Over 1.5 million\nliving\nanimal\nspecies\nhave been\ndescribed\n—of which around 1 million are\ninsects\n—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. They have\ncomplex interactions\nwith each other and their environments, forming intricate\nfood webs\n.\n[\n133\n]\nViruses\nMain article:\nVirus\nBacteriophages\nattached to a bacterial cell wall\nViruses are\nsubmicroscopic\ninfectious agents\nthat\nreplicate\ninside the\ncells\nof\norganisms\n.\n[\n134\n]\nViruses infect all types of\nlife forms\n, from animals and plants to\nmicroorganisms\n, including bacteria and\narchaea\n.\n[\n135\n]\n[\n136\n]\nMore than 6,000\nvirus species\nhave been described in detail.\n[\n137\n]\nViruses are found in almost every\necosystem\non Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity.\n[\n138\n]\n[\n139\n]\nThe origins of viruses in the evolutionary\nhistory of life\nare unclear: some may have\nevolved\nfrom\nplasmids\n—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of\nhorizontal gene transfer\n, which increases\ngenetic diversity\nin a way analogous to\nsexual reproduction\n.\n[\n140\n]\nBecause viruses possess some but not all characteristics of life, they have been described as \"organisms at the edge of life\",\n[\n141\n]\nand as\nself-replicators\n.\n[\n142\n]\nEcology\nMain article:\nEcology\nEcology is the study of the distribution and abundance of life, the interaction between organisms and their\nenvironment\n.\n[\n143\n]\nEcosystems\nMain article:\nEcosystem\nThe\ncommunity\nof living (\nbiotic\n) organisms in conjunction with the nonliving (\nabiotic\n) components (e.g., water, light, radiation, temperature,\nhumidity\n,\natmosphere\n,\nacidity\n, and soil) of their environment is called an\necosystem\n.\n[\n144\n]\n[\n145\n]\n[\n146\n]\nThese biotic and abiotic components are linked together through\nnutrient cycles\nand energy flows.\n[\n147\n]\nEnergy from the sun enters the system through\nphotosynthesis\nand is incorporated into plant tissue. By feeding on plants and on one another, animals move\nmatter\nand energy through the system. They also influence the quantity of plant and\nmicrobial\nbiomass\npresent. By breaking down dead\norganic matter\n,\ndecomposers\nrelease\ncarbon\nback to the atmosphere and facilitate\nnutrient cycling\nby converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be readily used by plants and other microbes.\n[\n148\n]\nPopulations\nMain article:\nPopulation ecology\nReaching carrying capacity through a logistic growth curve\nA population is the group of\norganisms\nof the same\nspecies\nthat occupies an\narea\nand\nreproduce\nfrom generation to generation.\n[\n149\n]\n[\n150\n]\n[\n151\n]\n[\n152\n]\n[\n153\n]\nPopulation size\ncan be estimated by multiplying population density by the area or volume. The\ncarrying capacity\nof an\nenvironment\nis the maximum population size of a\nspecies\nthat can be sustained by that specific environment, given the food,\nhabitat\n,\nwater\n, and other\nresources\nthat are available.\n[\n154\n]\nThe carrying capacity of a population can be affected by changing environmental conditions such as changes in the availability of resources and the cost of maintaining them. In\nhuman populations\n, new\ntechnologies\nsuch as the\nGreen revolution\nhave helped increase the Earth's carrying capacity for humans over time, which has stymied the attempted predictions of impending population decline, the most famous of which was by\nThomas Malthus\nin the 18th century.\n[\n149\n]\nCommunities\nMain article:\nCommunity (ecology)\nA (a) trophic pyramid and a (b) simplified food web. The trophic pyramid represents the biomass at each level.\n[\n155\n]\nA community is a group of populations of species occupying the same geographical area at the same time.\n[\n156\n]\nA\nbiological interaction\nis the effect that a pair of\norganisms\nliving together in a community have on each other. They can be either of the same species (intraspecific interactions), or of different species (interspecific interactions). These effects may be short-term, like\npollination\nand\npredation\n, or long-term; both often strongly influence the\nevolution\nof the species involved. A long-term interaction is called a\nsymbiosis\n. Symbioses range from\nmutualism\n, beneficial to both partners, to\ncompetition\n, harmful to both partners.\n[\n157\n]\nEvery species participates as a consumer, resource, or both in\nconsumer–resource interactions\n, which form the core of\nfood chains\nor\nfood webs\n.\n[\n158\n]\nThere are different\ntrophic levels\nwithin any food web, with the lowest level being the primary producers (or\nautotrophs\n) such as plants and algae that convert energy and inorganic material into\norganic compounds\n, which can then be used by the rest of the community.\n[\n50\n]\n[\n159\n]\n[\n160\n]\nAt the next level are the\nheterotrophs\n, which are the species that obtain energy by breaking apart organic compounds from other organisms.\n[\n158\n]\nHeterotrophs that consume plants are primary consumers (or\nherbivores\n) whereas heterotrophs that consume herbivores are secondary consumers (or\ncarnivores\n). And those that eat secondary consumers are tertiary consumers and so on.\nOmnivorous\nheterotrophs are able to consume at multiple levels. Finally, there are\ndecomposers\nthat feed on the waste products or dead bodies of organisms.\n[\n158\n]\nOn average, the total amount of energy incorporated into the\nbiomass\nof a trophic level per unit of time is about one-tenth of the energy of the trophic level that it consumes. Waste and dead material used by decomposers as well as heat lost from metabolism make up the other ninety percent of energy that is not consumed by the next trophic level.\n[\n161\n]\nBiosphere\nMain article:\nBiosphere\nFast carbon cycle\nshowing the movement of carbon between land, atmosphere, and oceans in billions of tons per year. Yellow numbers are natural fluxes, red are human contributions, white are stored carbon. Effects of the\nslow carbon cycle\n, such as volcanic and tectonic activity, are not included.\n[\n162\n]\nIn the global ecosystem or biosphere, matter exists as different interacting compartments, which can be biotic or abiotic as well as accessible or inaccessible, depending on their forms and locations.\n[\n163\n]\nFor example, matter from terrestrial autotrophs are both biotic and accessible to other organisms whereas the matter in rocks and minerals are abiotic and inaccessible. A\nbiogeochemical cycle\nis a pathway by which specific\nelements\nof matter are turned over or moved through the biotic (\nbiosphere\n) and the abiotic (\nlithosphere\n,\natmosphere\n, and\nhydrosphere\n) compartments of Earth. There are biogeochemical cycles for\nnitrogen\n,\ncarbon\n, and\nwater\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nConservation\nMain article:\nConservation biology\nConservation biology is the study of the conservation of Earth's\nbiodiversity\nwith the aim of protecting\nspecies\n, their\nhabitats\n, and\necosystems\nfrom excessive rates of\nextinction\nand the erosion of biotic interactions.\n[\n164\n]\n[\n165\n]\n[\n166\n]\nIt is concerned with factors that influence the maintenance, loss, and restoration of biodiversity and the science of sustaining evolutionary processes that engender\ngenetic\n, population,\nspecies\n, and ecosystem diversity.\n[\n167\n]\n[\n168\n]\n[\n169\n]\n[\n170\n]\nThe concern stems from estimates suggesting that up to 50% of all species on the planet will disappear within the next 50 years,\n[\n171\n]\nwhich has contributed to poverty, starvation, and will reset the course of evolution on this planet.\n[\n172\n]\n[\n173\n]\nBiodiversity\naffects the functioning of ecosystems, which provide a variety of\nservices\nupon which people depend. Conservation biologists research and educate on the trends of\nbiodiversity loss\n, species\nextinctions\n, and the negative effect these are having on our capabilities to\nsustain\nthe well-being of human society. Organizations and citizens are responding to the\ncurrent biodiversity crisis\nthrough conservation action plans that direct research, monitoring, and education programs that engage concerns at local through global scales.\n[\n174\n]\n[\n167\n]\n[\n168\n]\n[\n169\n]\nSee also\nBiology in fiction\nGlossary of biology\nList of biological websites\nList of biologists\nList of biology journals\nList of biology topics\nList of life sciences\nList of omics topics in biology\nNational Association of Biology Teachers\nOutline of biology\nPeriodic table of life sciences in\nTinbergen's four questions\nScience tourism\nTerminology of biology\nReferences\n^\nModell, Harold; Cliff, William; Michael, Joel; McFarland, Jenny; Wenderoth, Mary Pat; Wright, Ann (December 2015).\n\"A physiologist's view of homeostasis\"\n.\nAdvances in Physiology Education\n.\n39\n(4):\n259–\n266.\ndoi\n:\n10.1152/advan.00107.2015\n.\nISSN\n1043-4046\n.\nPMC\n4669363\n.\nPMID\n26628646\n.\n^\nDavies, PC; Rieper, E; Tuszynski, JA (January 2013).\n\"Self-organization and entropy reduction in a living cell\"\n.\nBio Systems\n.\n111\n(1):\n1–\n10.\nBibcode\n:\n2013BiSys.111....1D\n.\ndoi\n:\n10.1016/j.biosystems.2012.10.005\n.\nPMC\n3712629\n.\nPMID\n23159919\n.\n^\na\nb\nPearce, Ben K.D.; Tupper, Andrew S.;\nPudritz, Ralph E.\n; et al.

The applications of various fields of chemistry are used frequently for economic purposes in the\nchemical industry\n.\n[\n11\n]\nEtymology\nMain article:\nEtymology of chemistry\nThe word\nchemistry\ncomes from a modification during the\nRenaissance\nof the word\nalchemy\n,\nwhich referred to an earlier set of practices that encompassed elements of chemistry,\nmetallurgy\n,\nphilosophy\n,\nastrology\n,\nastronomy\n,\nmysticism\n, and\nmedicine\n. Alchemy is often associated with the quest to turn lead or other base metals into gold, though\nalchemists\nwere also interested in many of the questions of modern chemistry.\n[\n12\n]\n[\n13\n]\n[\n14\n]\nThe modern word\nalchemy\nin turn is derived from the\nArabic\nword\nal-kīmīā\n(\nالكیمیاء\n). This may have\nEgyptian\norigins since\nal-kīmīā\nis derived from the\nAncient Greek\nχημία\n, which is in turn derived from the word\nKemet\n, which is the ancient name of Egypt in the Egyptian language.\n[\n15\n]\nAlternately,\nal-kīmīā\nmay derive from\nχημεία\n'cast together'.\n[\n16\n]\nModern principles\nLaboratory\n, Institute of Biochemistry,\nUniversity of Cologne\nin\nGermany\nThe current model of atomic structure is the\nquantum mechanical model\n.\n[\n17\n]\nTraditional chemistry starts with the study of\nelementary particles\n,\natoms\n,\nmolecules\n,\n[\n18\n]\nsubstances\n,\nmetals\n,\ncrystals\nand other aggregates of\nmatter\n. Matter can be studied in solid, liquid, gas and plasma\nstates\n, in isolation or in combination. The interactions,\nreactions\nand transformations that are studied in chemistry are usually the result of interactions between atoms, leading to rearrangements of the\nchemical bonds\nwhich hold atoms together. Such behaviors are studied in a chemistry\nlaboratory\n.\nThe chemistry laboratory stereotypically uses various forms of\nlaboratory glassware\n. However glassware is not central to chemistry, and a great deal of experimental (as well as applied/industrial) chemistry is done without it.\nSolutions of substances in reagent bottles, including\nammonium hydroxide\nand\nnitric acid\n, illuminated in different colors\nA\nchemical reaction\nis a transformation of some substances into one or more different substances.\n[\n19\n]\nThe basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms. It can be symbolically depicted through a\nchemical equation\n, which usually involves atoms as subjects. The number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is equal. (When the number of atoms on either side is unequal, the transformation is referred to as a\nnuclear reaction\nor\nradioactive decay\n.) The type of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules, known as\nchemical laws\n.\nEnergy\nand\nentropy\nconsiderations are invariably important in almost all chemical studies. Chemical substances are classified in terms of their\nstructure\n, phase, as well as their\nchemical compositions\n. They can be analyzed using the tools of\nchemical analysis\n, e.g.\nspectroscopy\nand\nchromatography\n. Scientists engaged in chemical research are known as\nchemists\n.\n[\n20\n]\nMost chemists specialize in one or more sub-disciplines. Several\nconcepts\nare essential for the study of chemistry; some of them are:\n[\n21\n]\nMatter\nMain article:\nMatter\nIn chemistry, matter is defined as anything that has\nrest mass\nand\nvolume\n(it takes up space) and is made up of\nparticles\n. The particles that make up matter have rest mass as well – not all particles have rest mass, such as the\nphoton\n. Matter can be a pure\nchemical substance\nor a\nmixture\nof substances.\n[\n22\n]\nAtom\nMain article:\nAtom\nA diagram of an atom based on the\nRutherford model\nThe\natom\nis the basic unit of chemistry. It consists of a dense core called the\natomic nucleus\nsurrounded by a space occupied by an\nelectron cloud\n. The nucleus is made up of positively charged\nprotons\nand uncharged\nneutrons\n(together called\nnucleons\n), while the\nelectron\ncloud consists of negatively charged\nelectrons\nwhich orbit the nucleus. In a neutral atom, the negatively charged electrons balance out the positive charge of the protons. The nucleus is dense; the mass of a nucleon is approximately 1,836 times that of an electron, yet the radius of an atom is about 10,000 times that of its nucleus.\n[\n23\n]\n[\n24\n]\nThe atom is also the smallest entity that can be envisaged to retain the\nchemical properties\nof the element, such as\nelectronegativity\n,\nionization potential\n, preferred\noxidation state\n(s),\ncoordination number\n, and preferred types of bonds to form (e.g.,\nmetallic\n,\nionic\n,\ncovalent\n).\nElement\nStandard form of the\nperiodic table\nof chemical elements. The colors represent different\nblocks\nof elements.\nMain article:\nChemical element\nA chemical element is a pure substance which is composed of a single type of atom, characterized by its particular number of\nprotons\nin the nuclei of its atoms, known as the\natomic number\nand represented by the symbol\nZ\n. The\nmass number\nis the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus. Although all the nuclei of all atoms belonging to one element will have the same atomic number, they may not necessarily have the same mass number; atoms of an element which have different mass numbers are known as\nisotopes\n. For example, all atoms with 6 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical element\ncarbon\n, but atoms of carbon may have mass numbers of 12 or 13.\n[\n24\n]\nThe standard presentation of the chemical elements is in the\nperiodic table\n, which orders elements by atomic number. The periodic table is arranged in\ngroups\n, or columns, and\nperiods\n, or rows. The periodic table is useful in identifying\nperiodic trends\n.\n[\n25\n]\nCompound\nCarbon dioxide\n(CO\n2\n), an example of a chemical compound\nMain article:\nChemical compound\nA\ncompound\nis a pure chemical substance composed of more than one element. The properties of a compound bear little similarity to those of its elements.\n[\n26\n]\nThe standard nomenclature of compounds is set by the\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n(IUPAC).\nOrganic compounds\nare named according to the\norganic nomenclature\nsystem.\n[\n27\n]\nThe names for\ninorganic compounds\nare created according to the\ninorganic nomenclature\nsystem. When a compound has more than one component, then they are divided into two classes, the electropositive and the electronegative components.\n[\n28\n]\nIn addition the\nChemical Abstracts Service (CAS)\nhas devised a method to index chemical substances. In this scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as its\nCAS registry number\n.\nMolecule\nMain article:\nMolecule\nA ball-and-stick representation of the\ncaffeine\nmolecule (C\n8\nH\n10\nN\n4\nO\n2\n)\nA\nmolecule\nis the smallest indivisible portion of a pure\nchemical substance\nthat has its unique set of chemical properties, that is, its potential to undergo a certain set of chemical reactions with other substances. However, this definition only works well for substances that are composed of molecules, which is not true of many substances (see below). Molecules are typically a set of atoms bound together by\ncovalent bonds\n, such that the structure is electrically neutral and all valence electrons are paired with other electrons either in bonds or in\nlone pairs\n.\nThus, molecules exist as electrically neutral units, unlike ions. When this rule is broken, giving the \"molecule\" a charge, the result is sometimes named a\nmolecular ion\nor a polyatomic ion. However, the discrete and separate nature of the molecular concept usually requires that molecular ions be present only in well-separated form, such as a directed beam in a vacuum in a\nmass spectrometer\n. Charged polyatomic collections residing in solids (for example, common\nsulfate\nor\nnitrate\nions) are generally not considered \"molecules\" in chemistry. Some molecules contain one or more unpaired electrons, creating\nradicals\n. Most radicals are comparatively reactive, but some, such as\nnitric oxide\n(NO) can be stable.\nA 2-D\nstructural formula\nof a\nbenzene\nmolecule (C\n6\nH\n6\n)\nThe \"inert\" or\nnoble gas elements\n(\nhelium\n,\nneon\n,\nargon\n,\nkrypton\n,\nxenon\nand\nradon\n) are composed of lone atoms as their smallest discrete unit, but the other isolated chemical elements consist of either molecules or networks of atoms bonded to each other in some way. Identifiable molecules compose familiar substances such as water, air, and many organic compounds like alcohol, sugar, gasoline, and the various\npharmaceuticals\n.\nHowever, not all substances or chemical compounds consist of discrete molecules, and indeed most of the solid substances that make up the solid crust, mantle, and core of the Earth are chemical compounds without molecules. These other types of substances, such as\nionic compounds\nand\nnetwork solids\n, are organized in such a way as to lack the existence of identifiable molecules\nper se\n. Instead, these substances are discussed in terms of\nformula units\nor\nunit cells\nas the smallest repeating structure within the substance. Examples of such substances are mineral salts (such as\ntable salt\n), solids like carbon and diamond, metals, and familiar\nsilica\nand\nsilicate minerals\nsuch as quartz and granite.\nOne of the main characteristics of a molecule is its geometry often called its\nstructure\n. While the structure of\ndiatomic\n,\ntriatomic\nor tetra-atomic molecules may be trivial, (\nlinear\n, angular pyramidal etc.) the structure of polyatomic molecules, that are constituted of more than six atoms (of several elements) can be crucial for its chemical nature.\nSubstance and mixture\nExamples of pure chemical substances. From left to right: the elements\ntin\n(Sn) and\nsulfur\n(S),\ndiamond\n(an\nallotrope\nof\ncarbon\n),\nsucrose\n(pure sugar), and\nsodium chloride\n(salt) and\nsodium bicarbonate\n(baking soda), which are both ionic compounds.\nA chemical substance is a kind of matter with a definite\ncomposition\nand set of\nproperties\n.\n[\n29\n]\nA collection of substances is called a mixture. Examples of mixtures are\nair\nand\nalloys\n.\n[\n30\n]\nMole and amount of substance\nMain article:\nMole\nThe mole is a unit of measurement that denotes an\namount of substance\n(also called chemical amount). One mole is defined to contain exactly\n6.022\n140\n76\n×\n10\n23\nparticles (atoms, molecules, ions, or electrons), where the\nnumber of particles\nper mole is known as the\nAvogadro constant\n.\n[\n31\n]\nMolar concentration\nis the amount of a particular substance per volume of\nsolution\n, and is commonly reported in mol/\ndm\n3\n.\n[\n32\n]\nPhase\nDiagram showing relationships among the phases and the terms used to describe phase changes\nMain article:\nPhase\nIn addition to the specific chemical properties that distinguish different chemical classifications, chemicals can exist in several phases. For the most part, the chemical classifications are independent of these bulk phase classifications; however, some more exotic phases are incompatible with certain chemical properties. A\nphase\nis a set of states of a chemical system that have similar bulk structural properties, over a range of conditions, such as\npressure\nor\ntemperature\n.\nPhysical properties, such as\ndensity\nand\nrefractive index\ntend to fall within values characteristic of the phase. The phase of matter is defined by the\nphase transition\n, which is when energy put into or taken out of the system goes into rearranging the structure of the system, instead of changing the bulk conditions.\nSometimes the distinction between phases can be continuous instead of having a discrete boundary; in this case the matter is considered to be in a\nsupercritical\nstate. When three states meet based on the conditions, it is known as a\ntriple point\nand since this is invariant, it is a convenient way to define a set of conditions.\nThe most familiar examples of phases are\nsolids\n,\nliquids\n, and\ngases\n. Many substances exhibit multiple solid phases. For example, there are three phases of solid\niron\n(alpha, gamma, and delta) that vary based on temperature and pressure. A principal difference between solid phases is the\ncrystal structure\n, or arrangement, of the atoms. Another phase commonly encountered in the study of chemistry is the\naqueous\nphase, which is the state of substances dissolved in\naqueous solution\n(that is, in water).\nLess familiar phases include\nplasmas\n,\nBose–Einstein condensates\nand\nfermionic condensates\nand the\nparamagnetic\nand\nferromagnetic\nphases of\nmagnetic\nmaterials. While most familiar phases deal with three-dimensional systems, it is also possible to define analogs in two-dimensional systems, which has received attention for its relevance to systems in\nbiology\n.\nBonding\nMain article:\nChemical bond\nAn animation of the process of ionic bonding between\nsodium\n(Na) and\nchlorine\n(Cl) to form\nsodium chloride\n, or common table salt. Ionic bonding involves one atom taking valence electrons from another (as opposed to sharing, which occurs in covalent bonding).\nAtoms sticking together in molecules or crystals are said to be bonded with one another. A chemical bond may be visualized as the\nmultipole\nbalance between the positive charges in the nuclei and the negative charges oscillating about them.\n[\n33\n]\nMore than simple attraction and repulsion, the energies and distributions characterize the availability of an electron to bond to another atom.\nThe chemical bond can be a\ncovalent bond\n, an\nionic bond\n, a\nhydrogen bond\nor just because of\nVan der Waals force\n. Each of these kinds of bonds is ascribed to some potential. These potentials create the interactions which hold atoms together in\nmolecules\nor\ncrystals\n. In many simple compounds,\nvalence bond theory\n, the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion model (\nVSEPR\n), and the concept of\noxidation number\ncan be used to explain molecular structure and composition.\nAn ionic bond is formed when a metal loses one or more of its electrons, becoming a positively charged cation, and the electrons are then gained by the non-metal atom, becoming a negatively charged anion. The two oppositely charged ions attract one another, and the ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between them. For example,\nsodium\n(Na), a metal, loses one electron to become an Na\n+\ncation while\nchlorine\n(Cl), a non-metal, gains this electron to become\nCl\n−\n. The ions are held together due to electrostatic attraction, and that compound\nsodium chloride\n(NaCl), or common table salt, is formed.\nIn the\nmethane\nmolecule (CH\n4\n), the carbon atom shares a pair of valence electrons with each of the four hydrogen atoms. Thus, the octet rule is satisfied for C-atom (it has eight electrons in its valence shell) and the duet rule is satisfied for the H-atoms (they have two electrons in their valence shells).\nIn a covalent bond, one or more pairs of\nvalence electrons\nare shared by two atoms: the resulting electrically neutral group of bonded atoms is termed a\nmolecule\n. Atoms will share valence electrons in such a way as to create a\nnoble gas\nelectron configuration (eight electrons in their outermost shell) for each atom. Atoms that tend to combine in such a way that they each have eight electrons in their valence shell are said to follow the\noctet rule\n. However, some elements like\nhydrogen\nand\nlithium\nneed only two electrons in their outermost shell to attain this stable configuration; these atoms are said to follow the\nduet rule\n, and in this way they are reaching the electron configuration of the noble gas\nhelium\n, which has two electrons in its outer shell.\nSimilarly, theories from\nclassical physics\ncan be used to predict many ionic structures. With more complicated compounds, such as\nmetal complexes\n, valence bond theory is less applicable and alternative approaches, such as the\nmolecular orbital\ntheory, are generally used.\nEnergy\nMain article:\nEnergy\nIn the context of chemistry, energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its\natomic\n,\nmolecular\nor aggregate\nstructure\n. Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structures, it is invariably accompanied by an\nincrease\nor\ndecrease\nof\nenergy\nof the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or\nlight\n; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants.\nA reaction is said to be\nexergonic\nif the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of\nendergonic reactions\nthe situation is the reverse. A reaction is said to be\nexothermic\nif the reaction releases heat to the surroundings; in the case of\nendothermic reactions\n, the reaction absorbs heat from the surroundings.\nChemical reactions are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the\nactivation energy\n. The\nspeed\nof a chemical reaction (at given temperature T) is related to the activation energy E, by the Boltzmann's population factor\ne\n−\nE\n/\nk\nT\n{\\displaystyle e^{-E/kT}}\n– that is the probability of a molecule to have energy greater than or equal to E at the given temperature T. This exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the\nArrhenius equation\n. The activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction to occur can be in the form of heat, light,\nelectricity\nor mechanical\nforce\nin the form of\nultrasound\n.\n[\n34\n]\nA related concept\nfree energy\n, which also incorporates entropy considerations, is a very useful means for predicting the feasibility of a reaction and determining the state of equilibrium of a chemical reaction, in\nchemical thermodynamics\n. A reaction is feasible only if the total change in the\nGibbs free energy\nis negative,\nΔ\nG\n≤\n0\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta G\\leq 0\\,}\n; if it is equal to zero the chemical reaction is said to be at\nequilibrium\n.\nThere exist only limited possible states of energy for electrons, atoms and molecules. These are determined by the rules of\nquantum mechanics\n, which require\nquantization\nof energy of a bound system. The atoms/molecules in a higher energy state are said to be excited. The molecules/atoms of substance in an excited energy state are often much more reactive; that is, more amenable to chemical reactions.\nThe phase of a substance is invariably determined by its energy and the energy of its surroundings. When the\nintermolecular forces\nof a substance are such that the energy of the surroundings is not sufficient to overcome them, it occurs in a more ordered phase like liquid or solid as is the case with water (H\n2\nO); a liquid at room temperature because its molecules are bound by\nhydrogen bonds\n.\n[\n35\n]\nWhereas\nhydrogen sulfide\n(H\n2\nS) is a gas at room temperature and standard pressure, as its molecules are bound by weaker\ndipole–dipole interactions\n.\nThe transfer of energy from one chemical substance to another depends on the\nsize\nof energy\nquanta\nemitted from one substance. However, heat energy is often transferred more easily from almost any substance to another because the\nphonons\nresponsible for vibrational and rotational energy levels in a substance have much less energy than\nphotons\ninvoked for the electronic energy transfer. Thus, because vibrational and rotational energy levels are more closely spaced than electronic energy levels, heat is more easily transferred between substances relative to light or other forms of electronic energy. For example,\nultraviolet\nelectromagnetic radiation is not transferred with as much efficacy from one substance to another as thermal or electrical energy.\nThe existence of characteristic energy levels for different\nchemical substances\nis useful for their identification by the analysis of\nspectral lines\n. Different kinds of spectra are often used in chemical\nspectroscopy\n, e.g.\nIR\n,\nmicrowave\n,\nNMR\n,\nESR\n, etc. Spectroscopy is also used to identify the composition of remote objects – like stars and distant galaxies – by analyzing their radiation spectra.\nEmission spectrum of\niron\nThe term\nchemical energy\nis often used to indicate the potential of a chemical substance to undergo a transformation through a\nchemical reaction\nor to transform other chemical substances.\nReaction\nMain article:\nChemical reaction\nDuring chemical reactions, bonds between atoms break and form, resulting in different substances with different properties. In a blast furnace, iron oxide, a\ncompound\n, reacts with carbon monoxide to form iron, one of the\nchemical elements\n, and carbon dioxide.\nWhen a chemical substance is transformed as a result of its interaction with another substance or with energy, a chemical reaction is said to have occurred. A\nchemical reaction\nis therefore a concept related to the \"reaction\" of a substance when it comes in close contact with another, whether as a mixture or a\nsolution\n; exposure to some form of energy, or both. It results in some energy exchange between the constituents of the reaction as well as with the system environment, which may be designed vessels—often\nlaboratory glassware\n.\nChemical reactions can result in the formation or\ndissociation\nof molecules, that is, molecules breaking apart to form two or more molecules or rearrangement of atoms within or across molecules. Chemical reactions usually involve the making or breaking of chemical bonds.\nOxidation, reduction\n,\ndissociation\n, acid–base\nneutralization\nand molecular\nrearrangement\nare some examples of common chemical reactions.\nA chemical reaction can be symbolically depicted through a\nchemical equation\n. While in a non-nuclear chemical reaction the number and kind of atoms on both sides of the equation are equal, for a nuclear reaction this holds true only for the nuclear particles viz. protons and neutrons.\n[\n36\n]\nThe sequence of steps in which the reorganization of chemical bonds may be taking place in the course of a chemical reaction is called its\nmechanism\n. A chemical reaction can be envisioned to take place in a number of steps, each of which may have a different speed. Many\nreaction intermediates\nwith variable stability can thus be envisaged during the course of a reaction. Reaction mechanisms are proposed to explain the\nkinetics\nand the relative product mix of a reaction. Many\nphysical chemists\nspecialize in exploring and proposing the mechanisms of various chemical reactions. Several empirical rules, like the\nWoodward–Hoffmann rules\noften come in handy while proposing a mechanism for a chemical reaction.\nAccording to the\nIUPAC\ngold book, a chemical reaction is \"a process that results in the interconversion of chemical species.\"\n[\n37\n]\nAccordingly, a chemical reaction may be an\nelementary reaction\nor a\nstepwise reaction\n. An additional caveat is made, in that this definition includes cases where the\ninterconversion of conformers\nis experimentally observable. Such detectable chemical reactions normally involve sets of molecular entities as indicated by this definition, but it is often conceptually convenient to use the term also for changes involving single molecular entities (i.e. 'microscopic chemical events').\nIons and salts\nThe crystal lattice structure of\npotassium chloride\n(KCl), a salt which is formed due to the attraction of K\n+\ncations and Cl\n−\nanions. The overall charge of the ionic compound is zero.\nMain article:\nIon\nAn\nion\nis a charged species, an atom or a molecule, that has lost or gained one or more electrons. When an atom loses an electron and thus has more protons than electrons, the atom is a positively charged ion or\ncation\n. When an atom gains an electron and thus has more electrons than protons, the atom is a negatively charged ion or\nanion\n. Cations and anions can form a crystalline lattice of neutral\nsalts\n, such as the Na\n+\nand Cl\n−\nions forming\nsodium chloride\n, or NaCl. Examples of\npolyatomic ions\nthat do not split up during\nacid–base reactions\nare\nhydroxide\n(OH\n−\n) and\nphosphate\n(PO\n4\n3−\n).\nPlasma\nis composed of gaseous matter that has been completely ionized, usually through high temperature.\nAcidity and basicity\nHydrogen bromide\nexists in the gas phase as a diatomic molecule.\nMain article:\nAcid–base reaction\nA substance can often be classified as an\nacid\nor a\nbase\n. There are several different theories which explain acid–base behavior. The simplest is\nArrhenius theory\n, which states that an acid is a substance that produces\nhydronium ions\nwhen it is dissolved in water, and a base is one that produces\nhydroxide ions\nwhen dissolved in water. According to\nBrønsted–Lowry acid–base theory\n, acids are substances that donate a positive\nhydrogen\nion\nto another substance in a chemical reaction; by extension, a base is the substance which receives that hydrogen ion.\nA third common theory is\nLewis acid–base theory\n, which is based on the formation of new chemical bonds. Lewis theory explains that an acid is a substance which is capable of accepting a pair of electrons from another substance during the process of bond formation, while a base is a substance which can provide a pair of electrons to form a new bond. There are several other ways in which a substance may be classified as an acid or a base, as is evident in the history of this concept.\n[\n38\n]\nAcid strength is commonly measured by two methods. One measurement, based on the Arrhenius definition of acidity, is\npH\n, which is a measurement of the hydronium ion concentration in a solution, as expressed on a negative\nlogarithmic\nscale. Thus, solutions that have a low pH have a high hydronium ion concentration and can be said to be more acidic. The other measurement, based on the Brønsted–Lowry definition, is the\nacid dissociation constant\n(K\na\n), which measures the relative ability of a substance to act as an acid under the Brønsted–Lowry definition of an acid. That is, substances with a higher K\na\nare more likely to donate hydrogen ions in chemical reactions than those with lower K\na\nvalues.\nRedox\nMain article:\nRedox\nRedox (\nred\nuction-\nox\nidation) reactions include all\nchemical reactions\nin which atoms have their\noxidation state\nchanged by either gaining electrons (reduction) or losing electrons (oxidation). Substances that have the ability to oxidize other substances are said to be oxidative and are known as\noxidizing agents\n, oxidants or oxidizers. An oxidant removes electrons from another substance. Similarly, substances that have the ability to reduce other substances are said to be reductive and are known as\nreducing agents\n, reductants, or reducers.\nA reductant transfers electrons to another substance and is thus oxidized itself. And because it \"donates\" electrons it is also called an electron donor. Oxidation and reduction properly refer to a change in oxidation number—the actual transfer of electrons may never occur. Thus, oxidation is better defined as an increase in\noxidation number\n, and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number.\nEquilibrium\nMain article:\nChemical equilibrium\nAlthough the concept of\nequilibrium\nis widely used across sciences, in the context of chemistry, it arises whenever a number of different states of the chemical composition are possible, as for example, in a mixture of several chemical compounds that can react with one another, or when a substance can be present in more than one kind of phase.\nA system of chemical substances at equilibrium, even though having an unchanging composition, is most often not\nstatic\n; molecules of the substances continue to react with one another thus giving rise to a\ndynamic equilibrium\n. Thus the concept describes the state in which the parameters such as chemical composition remain unchanged over time.\nChemical laws\nMain article:\nChemical law\nChemical reactions are governed by certain laws, which have become fundamental concepts in chemistry. Some of them are:\nAvogadro's law\nBeer–Lambert law\nBoyle's law\n(1662, relating pressure and volume)\nCharles's law\n(1787, relating volume and temperature)\nDalton's law\n(1803, law of partial pressures)\nFick's laws of diffusion\nGay-Lussac's law\n(1809, relating pressure and temperature)\nIdeal gas law\nLe Chatelier's principle\nHenry's law\nHess's law\nLaw of conservation of energy\nleads to the important concepts of\nequilibrium\n,\nthermodynamics\n, and\nkinetics\n.\nLaw of conservation of mass\ncontinues to be conserved in\nisolated systems\n, even in modern physics. However,\nspecial relativity\nshows that due to\nmass–energy equivalence\n, whenever non-material \"energy\" (heat, light, kinetic energy) is removed from a non-isolated system, some mass will be lost with it. High energy losses result in loss of weighable amounts of mass, an important topic in\nnuclear chemistry\n.\nLaw of definite proportions\n, although in many systems (notably biomacromolecules and minerals) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction.\nRaoult's law\nHistory\nMain article:\nHistory of chemistry\nFor a chronological guide, see\nTimeline of chemistry\n.\nThe\nhistory of chemistry\nspans a period from the ancient past to the present. Since several millennia BC, civilizations were using technologies that would eventually form the basis of the various branches of chemistry. Examples include extracting\nmetals\nfrom\nores\n, making pottery and glazes, fermenting beer and wine, extracting chemicals from plants for medicine and perfume, rendering fat into\nsoap\n, making\nglass\n, and making\nalloys\nlike\nbronze\n.\nChemistry was preceded by its protoscience,\nalchemy\n, which operated a non-scientific approach to understanding the constituents of matter and their interactions. Despite being unsuccessful in explaining the nature of matter and its transformations, alchemists set the stage for modern chemistry by performing experiments and recording the results.\nRobert Boyle\n, although skeptical of elements and convinced of alchemy, played a key part in elevating the \"sacred art\" as an independent, fundamental and philosophical discipline in his work\nThe Sceptical Chymist\n(1661).\n[\n39\n]\nWhile both alchemy and chemistry are concerned with matter and its transformations, the crucial difference was given by the\nscientific method\nthat\nchemists\nemployed in their work. Chemistry, as a body of knowledge distinct from alchemy, became an established science with the work of\nAntoine Lavoisier\n, who developed a law of\nconservation of mass\nthat demanded careful measurement and quantitative observations of chemical phenomena. The history of chemistry afterwards is intertwined with the\nhistory of thermodynamics\n, especially through the work of\nWillard Gibbs\n.\n[\n40\n]\nDefinition\nThe definition of chemistry has changed over time, as new discoveries and theories add to the functionality of the science. The term \"chymistry\", in the view of noted scientist\nRobert Boyle\nin 1661, meant the subject of the material principles of mixed bodies.\n[\n41\n]\nIn 1663, the chemist\nChristopher Glaser\ndescribed \"chymistry\" as a scientific art, by which one learns to dissolve bodies, and draw from them the different substances on their composition, and how to unite them again, and exalt them to a higher perfection.\n[\n42\n]\nThe 1730 definition of the word \"chemistry\", as used by\nGeorg Ernst Stahl\n, meant the art of resolving mixed, compound, or aggregate bodies into their principles; and of composing such bodies from those principles.\n[\n43\n]\nIn 1837,\nJean-Baptiste Dumas\nconsidered the word \"chemistry\" to refer to the science concerned with the laws and effects of molecular forces.\n[\n44\n]\nThis definition further evolved until, in 1947, it came to mean the science of substances: their structure, their properties, and the reactions that change them into other substances—a characterization accepted by\nLinus Pauling\n.\n[\n45\n]\nMore recently, in 1998, Professor\nRaymond Chang\nbroadened the definition of \"chemistry\" to mean the study of matter and the changes it undergoes.\n[\n46\n]\nBackground\nSee also:\nAlchemy\nDemocritus\n' atomist philosophy was later adopted by\nEpicurus\n(341–270 BCE).\nEarly civilizations, such as the\nEgyptians\n,\n[\n47\n]\nBabylonians\n, and\nIndians\n,\n[\n48\n]\namassed practical knowledge concerning the arts of metallurgy, pottery and dyes, but did not develop a systematic theory.\nA basic chemical hypothesis first emerged in\nClassical Greece\nwith the theory of\nfour elements\nas propounded definitively by\nAristotle\nstating that\nfire\n,\nair\n,\nearth\nand\nwater\nwere the fundamental elements from which everything is formed as a combination.\nGreek\natomism\ndates back to 440 BC, arising in works by philosophers such as\nDemocritus\nand\nEpicurus\n. In 50 BCE, the\nRoman\nphilosopher\nLucretius\nexpanded upon the theory in his poem\nDe rerum natura\n(On The Nature of Things).\n[\n49\n]\n[\n50\n]\nUnlike modern concepts of science, Greek atomism was purely philosophical in nature, with little concern for empirical observations and no concern for chemical experiments.\n[\n51\n]\nAn early form of the idea of\nconservation of mass\nis the notion that \"\nNothing comes from nothing\n\" in\nAncient Greek philosophy\n, which can be found in\nEmpedocles\n(approx. 4th century BC): \"For it is impossible for anything to come to be from what is not, and it cannot be brought about or heard of that what is should be utterly destroyed.\"\n[\n52\n]\nand\nEpicurus\n(3rd century BC), who, describing the nature of the Universe, wrote that \"the totality of things was always such as it is now, and always will be\".\n[\n53\n]\n15th-century artistic impression of\nJābir ibn Hayyān\n(Geber), a\nPerso-Arab alchemist\nand pioneer in\norganic chemistry\nIn the\nHellenistic world\nthe art of alchemy first proliferated, mingling magic and occultism into the study of natural substances with the ultimate goal of transmuting elements into\ngold\nand discovering the elixir of eternal life.\n[\n54\n]\nWork, particularly the development of\ndistillation\n, continued in the early\nByzantine\nperiod with the most famous practitioner being the 4th century Greek-Egyptian\nZosimos of Panopolis\n.\n[\n55\n]\nAlchemy continued to be developed and practised throughout the\nArab world\nafter the\nMuslim conquests\n,\n[\n56\n]\nand from there, and from the Byzantine remnants,\n[\n57\n]\ndiffused into medieval and\nRenaissance\nEurope through Latin translations.\nThe Arabic works attributed to\nJabir ibn Hayyan\nintroduced a systematic classification of chemical substances, and provided instructions for deriving an inorganic compound (\nsal ammoniac\nor\nammonium chloride\n) from\norganic substances\n(such as plants, blood, and hair) by chemical means.\n[\n58\n]\nSome Arabic Jabirian works (e.g., the \"Book of Mercy\", and the \"Book of Seventy\") were later translated into Latin under the\nLatinized\nname \"Geber\",\n[\n59\n]\nand in 13th-century Europe an anonymous writer, usually referred to as\npseudo-Geber\n, started to produce alchemical and metallurgical writings under this name.\n[\n60\n]\nLater influential Muslim philosophers, such as\nAbū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī\n[\n61\n]\nand\nAvicenna\n[\n62\n]\ndisputed the theories of alchemy, particularly the theory of the\ntransmutation of metals\n.\nGeorgius Agricola\n, author of\nDe re metallica\n, was the first to drop the Arabic definite article\nal-\n, exclusively writing\nchymia\nand\nchymista\n, giving chemistry its modern name.\n[\n63\n]\n[\n64\n]\n[\n65\n]\nImprovements of the refining of ores and their extractions to smelt metals was widely used source of information for early chemists in the 16th century, among them\nGeorg Agricola\n(1494–1555), who published his major work\nDe re metallica\nin 1556. His work, describing highly developed and complex processes of mining metal ores and metal extraction, were the pinnacle of metallurgy during that time. His approach removed all mysticism associated with the subject, creating the practical base upon which others could and would build. The work describes the many kinds of furnaces used to smelt ore, and stimulated interest in minerals and their composition. Agricola has been described as the \"father of metallurgy\" and the founder of\ngeology\nas a scientific discipline.\n[\n66\n]\n[\n64\n]\n[\n65\n]\nUnder the influence of the\nScientific Revolution\nand its new empirical methods propounded by\nSir Francis Bacon\nand others, a group of chemists at\nOxford\n,\nRobert Boyle\n,\nRobert Hooke\nand\nJohn Mayow\nbegan to reshape the old alchemical traditions into a scientific discipline. Boyle in particular questioned some commonly held chemical theories and argued for chemical practitioners to be more \"philosophical\" and less commercially focused in\nThe Sceptical Chemyst\n.\n[\n39\n]\nHe formulated\nBoyle's law\n, rejected the classical \"four elements\" and proposed a mechanistic alternative of atoms and\nchemical reactions\nthat could be subject to rigorous experiment.\n[\n67\n]\nAntoine-Laurent de Lavoisier\nis considered the \"Father of Modern Chemistry\".\n[\n68\n]\nIn the following decades, many important discoveries were made, such as the nature of 'air' which was discovered to be composed of many different gases. The Scottish chemist\nJoseph Black\nand the Flemish\nJan Baptist van Helmont\ndiscovered\ncarbon dioxide\n, or what Black called 'fixed air' in 1754;\nHenry Cavendish\ndiscovered\nhydrogen\nand elucidated its properties and\nJoseph Priestley\nand, independently,\nCarl Wilhelm Scheele\nisolated pure\noxygen\n. The theory of\nphlogiston\n(a substance at the root of all combustion) was propounded by the German\nGeorg Ernst Stahl\nin the early 18th century and was only overturned by the end of the century by the French chemist\nAntoine Lavoisier\n, the chemical analogue of Newton in physics. Lavoisier did more than any other to establish the new science on proper theoretical footing, by elucidating the principle of\nconservation of mass\nand developing a new system of chemical nomenclature used to this day.\n[\n69\n]\nEnglish scientist\nJohn Dalton\nproposed the modern\ntheory of atoms\n; that all substances are composed of indivisible 'atoms' of matter and that different atoms have varying atomic weights.\nThe development of the electrochemical theory of chemical combinations occurred in the early 19th century as the result of the work of two scientists in particular,\nJöns Jacob Berzelius\nand\nHumphry Davy\n, made possible by the prior invention of the\nvoltaic pile\nby\nAlessandro Volta\n. Davy discovered nine new elements including the\nalkali metals\nby extracting them from their\noxides\nwith electric current.\n[\n70\n]\nIn his periodic table,\nDmitri Mendeleev\npredicted the existence of 7 new elements,\n[\n71\n]\nand placed all 60 elements known at the time in their correct places.\n[\n72\n]\nBritish\nWilliam Prout\nfirst proposed ordering all the elements by their atomic weight as all atoms had a weight that was an exact multiple of the atomic weight of hydrogen.\nJ.A.R. Newlands\ndevised an early table of elements, which was then developed into the modern\nperiodic table\nof elements\n[\n73\n]\nin the 1860s by\nDmitri Mendeleev\nand independently by several other scientists including\nJulius Lothar Meyer\n.\n[\n74\n]\n[\n75\n]\nThe inert gases, later called the\nnoble gases\nwere discovered by\nWilliam Ramsay\nin collaboration with\nLord Rayleigh\nat the end of the century, thereby filling in the basic structure of the table.\nOrganic chemistry was developed by\nJustus von Liebig\nand others, following\nFriedrich Wöhler\n's synthesis of\nurea\n.\n[\n76\n]\nOther crucial 19th century advances were; an understanding of valence bonding (\nEdward Frankland\nin 1852) and the application of thermodynamics to chemistry (\nJ. W. Gibbs\nand\nSvante Arrhenius\nin the 1870s).\nTop:\nExpected results:\nalpha particles\npassing through the\nplum pudding model\nof the atom undisturbed.\nBottom:\nObserved results: a small portion of the particles were deflected, indicating\na small, concentrated charge\n.\nAt the turn of the twentieth century the theoretical underpinnings of chemistry were finally understood due to a series of remarkable discoveries that succeeded in probing and discovering the very nature of the internal structure of atoms. In 1897,\nJ.J. Thomson\nof the\nUniversity of Cambridge\ndiscovered the\nelectron\nand soon after the French scientist\nBecquerel\nas well as the couple\nPierre\nand\nMarie Curie\ninvestigated the phenomenon of\nradioactivity\n. In a series of pioneering scattering experiments\nErnest Rutherford\nat the\nUniversity of Manchester\ndiscovered the internal structure of the atom and the existence of the proton, classified and explained the different types of radioactivity and successfully\ntransmuted\nthe first element by bombarding\nnitrogen\nwith\nalpha particles\n.\nHis work on atomic structure was improved on by his students, the Danish physicist\nNiels Bohr\n, the Englishman\nHenry Moseley\nand the German\nOtto Hahn\n, who went on to father the emerging\nnuclear chemistry\nand discovered\nnuclear fission\n. The electronic theory of\nchemical bonds\nand\nmolecular orbitals\nwas developed by the American scientists\nLinus Pauling\nand\nGilbert N. Lewis\n.\nThe year 2011 was declared by the United Nations as the International Year of Chemistry.\n[\n77\n]\nIt was an initiative of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, and of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization and involves chemical societies, academics, and institutions worldwide and relied on individual initiatives to organize local and regional activities.\nPractice\nIn the practice of chemistry,\npure chemistry\nis the study of the fundamental principles of chemistry, while\napplied chemistry\napplies that knowledge to develop technology and solve real-world problems.\nSubdisciplines\nSee also:\nOutline of chemistry § Branches of chemistry\nChemistry is typically divided into several major sub-disciplines. There are also several main cross-disciplinary and more specialized fields of chemistry.\n[\n78\n]\nAnalytical chemistry\nis the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their\nchemical composition\nand\nstructure\n. Analytical chemistry incorporates standardized experimental methods in chemistry. These methods may be used in all subdisciplines of chemistry, excluding purely theoretical chemistry.\n[\n79\n]\nIn analytical chemistry,\nspectroscopy\nstudies interactions between electromagnetic radiation (light) and matter.\n[\n80\n]\nA\nspectrophotometer\nis a machine used to measure the effect light has on matter. The model pictured is the Beckman DU-640\nBiochemistry\nis the study of the\nchemicals\n,\nchemical reactions\nand interactions that take place at a molecular level in living\norganisms\n. Biochemistry is highly interdisciplinary, covering\nmedicinal chemistry\n,\nneurochemistry\n,\nmolecular biology\n,\nforensics\n,\nplant science\nand\ngenetics\n.\n[\n81\n]\nInorganic chemistry\nis the study of the properties and reactions of inorganic compounds, such as metals and minerals.\n[\n82\n]\nThe distinction between organic and inorganic disciplines is not absolute and there is much overlap, most importantly in the sub-discipline of\norganometallic chemistry\n.\nThe\nKaminsky catalyst\nis an organometallic complex that features either\nzirconium\nor\nhafnium\nmetal centers. Depending on the placement of the catalyst's\ncyclopentadiene\nligands\n, it can produce\npolypropylenes\nwith different\ntacticity\n.\n[\n83\n]\n1\ncreates atactic polypropylene, which is soft and\namorphous\nwith a free-flowing composition.\n2\ncreates isotactic polypropylene, which is hard and used in re-usable plastic containers.\n3\ncreates syndiotactic polypropylene, which is rubbery and semi-crystalline.\n[\n84\n]\nMaterials chemistry\nis the preparation, characterization, and understanding of solid state components or devices with a useful current or future function.\n[\n85\n]\nThe field is a new breadth of study in graduate programs, and it integrates elements from all classical areas of chemistry like\norganic chemistry\n,\ninorganic chemistry\n, and\ncrystallography\nwith a focus on fundamental issues that are unique to\nmaterials\n. Primary systems of study include the chemistry of condensed phases (solids, liquids,\npolymers\n) and\ninterfaces\nbetween different phases.\nNeurochemistry\nis the study of\nneurochemicals\n; including transmitters, peptides, proteins, lipids, sugars, and nucleic acids; their interactions, and the roles they play in forming, maintaining, and modifying the nervous system.\nNuclear chemistry\nis the study of how subatomic particles come together and make nuclei. Modern\ntransmutation\nis a large component of nuclear chemistry, and the\ntable of nuclides\nis an important result and tool for this field. In addition to\nmedical applications\n, nuclear chemistry encompasses\nnuclear engineering\nwhich explores the topic of using\nnuclear power\nsources for generating energy.\n[\n86\n]\n[\n87\n]\nThe\nLittle Boy\nis an\natomic bomb\nutilizing a\nuranium-235\nfission reaction\n.\n[\n88\n]\nBy firing sub-critical uranium into another mass of sub-critical uranium within the bomb, creating a\nsupercritical mass\n, a self-sustaining nuclear reaction starts. It generated an explosive force of over 15,000 tons of equivalent TNT.\nOrganic chemistry\nis the study of the structure, properties, composition, mechanisms, and\nreactions\nof\norganic compounds\n. An organic compound is defined as any compound based on a carbon skeleton. Organic compounds can be classified, organized and understood in reactions by their\nfunctional groups\n, unit atoms or molecules that show characteristic chemical properties in a compound.\n[\n89\n]\n4-Hydroxybutanal\nis an\norganic compound\nwith an\naldehyde\n(right) functional group and an\nalcohol\n(left) functional group.\nPhysical chemistry\nis the study of the physical and fundamental basis of chemical systems and processes. In particular, the energetics and dynamics of such systems and processes are of interest to physical chemists. Important areas of study include\nchemical thermodynamics\n,\nchemical kinetics\n,\nelectrochemistry\n,\nstatistical mechanics\n,\nspectroscopy\n, and more recently,\nastrochemistry\n. Physical chemistry has large overlap with\nmolecular physics\n. Physical chemistry involves the use of\ninfinitesimal calculus\nin deriving equations. It is usually associated with\nquantum chemistry\nand theoretical chemistry. Physical chemistry is a distinct discipline from\nchemical physics\n, but again, there is very strong overlap.\nTheoretical chemistry\nis the study of chemistry via fundamental theoretical reasoning (usually within\nmathematics\nor\nphysics\n). In particular the application of\nquantum mechanics\nto chemistry is called\nquantum chemistry\n. Since the end of the\nSecond World War\n, the development of computers has allowed a systematic development of\ncomputational chemistry\n, which is the art of developing and applying\ncomputer programs\nfor solving chemical problems. Theoretical chemistry has large overlap with (theoretical and experimental)\ncondensed matter physics\nand\nmolecular physics\n.\nThe\nSolvay Conference of 1927\nfeatured foundational scientists to the field of theoretical chemistry and physics.

Physics intersects with many\ninterdisciplinary\nareas of research, such as\nbiophysics\nand\nquantum chemistry\n, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences\n[\n2\n]\nand suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.\nAdvances in physics often enable new\ntechnologies\n. For example, advances in the understanding of\nelectromagnetism\n,\nsolid-state physics\n, and\nnuclear physics\nled directly to the development of technologies that have transformed modern society, such as television, computers,\ndomestic appliances\n, and\nnuclear weapons\n;\n[\n2\n]\nadvances in\nthermodynamics\nled to the development of industrialization; and advances in\nmechanics\ninspired the development of\ncalculus\n.\nHistory\nMain article:\nHistory of physics\nThe word\nphysics\ncomes from the\nLatin\nphysica\n('study of nature'), which itself is a borrowing of the\nGreek\nφυσική\n(\nphusikḗ\n'natural science'), a term derived from\nφύσις\n(\nphúsis\n'origin, nature, property').\n[\n6\n]\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\nAncient astronomy\nMain article:\nHistory of astronomy\nAncient\nEgyptian astronomy\nis evident in monuments like the\nceiling of Senemut's tomb\nfrom the\nEighteenth Dynasty of Egypt\n.\nAstronomy\nis one of the oldest\nnatural sciences\n. Early civilizations dating before 3000 BCE, such as the\nSumerians\n,\nancient Egyptians\n, and the\nIndus Valley Civilization\n, had a predictive knowledge and a basic awareness of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars. The stars and planets, believed to represent gods, were often worshipped. While the explanations for the observed positions of the stars were often unscientific and lacking in evidence, these early observations laid the foundation for later astronomy, as the stars were found to traverse\ngreat circles\nacross the sky,\n[\n5\n]\nwhich could not explain the positions of the\nplanets\n.\nAccording to\nAsger Aaboe\n, the origins of Western astronomy can be found in\nMesopotamia\n, and all Western efforts in the\nexact sciences\nare descended from late\nBabylonian astronomy\n.\n[\n9\n]\nEgyptian astronomers\nleft monuments showing knowledge of the constellations and the motions of the celestial bodies,\n[\n10\n]\nwhile Greek poet\nHomer\nwrote of various celestial objects in his\nIliad\nand\nOdyssey\n; later\nGreek astronomers\nprovided names, which are still used today, for most constellations visible from the\nNorthern Hemisphere\n.\n[\n11\n]\nNatural philosophy\nMain article:\nNatural philosophy\nNatural philosophy\nhas its origins in\nGreece\nduring the\nArchaic period\n(650 BCE – 480 BCE), when\npre-Socratic philosophers\nlike\nThales\nrejected\nnon-naturalistic\nexplanations for natural phenomena and proclaimed that every event had a natural cause.\n[\n12\n]\nThey proposed ideas verified by reason and observation, and many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiment;\n[\n13\n]\nfor example,\natomism\nwas found to be correct approximately 2000 years after it was proposed by\nLeucippus\nand his pupil\nDemocritus\n.\n[\n14\n]\nAristotle and Hellenistic physics\nAristotle\n(384–322\nBCE\n)\nDuring the\nclassical period\nin Greece (6th, 5th and 4th centuries BCE) and in\nHellenistic times\n, natural philosophy developed along many lines of inquiry.\nAristotle\n(\nGreek\n:\nἈριστοτέλης\n,\nAristotélēs\n) (384–322 BCE), a student of\nPlato\n,\nwrote on many subjects, including a substantial treatise on \"\nPhysics\n\" – in the 4th century BC.\nAristotelian physics\nwas influential for about two millennia. His approach mixed some limited observation with logical deductive arguments, but did not rely on experimental verification of deduced statements.  Aristotle's foundational work in Physics, though very imperfect, formed a framework against which later thinkers further developed the field. His approach is entirely superseded today.\nHe explained ideas such as\nmotion\n(and\ngravity\n) with the theory of\nfour elements\n.\nAristotle believed that each of the four classical elements (air, fire, water, earth) had its own natural place.\n[\n15\n]\nBecause of their differing densities, each element will revert to its own specific place in the atmosphere.\n[\n16\n]\nSo, because of their weights, fire would be at the top, air underneath fire, then water, then lastly earth. He also stated that when a small amount of one element enters the natural place of another, the less abundant element will automatically go towards its own natural place.  For example, if there is a fire on the ground, the flames go up into the air in an attempt to go back into its natural place where it belongs.  His laws of motion included: that heavier objects will fall faster, the speed being proportional to the weight and the speed of the object that is falling depends inversely on the density object it is falling through (e.g. density of air).\n[\n17\n]\nHe also stated that, when it comes to violent motion (motion of an object when a force is applied to it by a second object), the speed that object moves will only be as fast or strong as the measure of force applied to it.\n[\n17\n]\nThe problem of motion and its causes was studied carefully, leading to the philosophical notion of a \"\nprime mover\n\" as the ultimate source of all motion in the world (Book 8 of his treatise\nPhysics\n).\nMedieval European and Islamic\nMain articles:\nEuropean science in the Middle Ages\nand\nPhysics in the medieval Islamic world\nIbn al-Haytham\n(\nc.\n965\n– c.\n1040\n) wrote of his\ncamera obscura\nexperiments in the\nBook of Optics\n.\n[\n18\n]\nThe\nWestern Roman Empire\nfell to invaders and internal decay in the fifth century, resulting in a decline in intellectual pursuits in western Europe. By contrast, the Eastern Roman Empire (usually known as the\nByzantine Empire\n) resisted the attacks from invaders and continued to advance various fields of learning, including physics.\n[\n19\n]\nIn the sixth century,\nJohn Philoponus\nchallenged the dominant Aristotelian approach to science although much of his work was focused on Christian theology.\n[\n20\n]\nIn the sixth century,\nIsidore of Miletus\ncreated an important compilation of\nArchimedes\n' works that are copied in the\nArchimedes Palimpsest\n.\nIslamic scholarship\ninherited\nAristotelian physics\nfrom the Greeks and during the\nIslamic Golden Age\ndeveloped it further.\nThe most notable innovations under Islamic scholarship were in the field of\noptics\nand vision,\n[\n21\n]\nwhich came from the works of many scientists like\nIbn Sahl\n,\nAl-Kindi\n,\nIbn al-Haytham\n,\nAl-Farisi\nand\nAvicenna\n.  In his Book of Optics (also known as Kitāb al-Manāẓir) Ibn al-Haytham presented the idea of light rays as an alternative to the ancient Greek idea about visual rays. Like Ptolemy, Ibn al-Haytham applied controlled experiments, verifying the laws of refraction and reflection with the new concept of light rays, but still lacking the concept of image formation.\n[\n22\n]\n[\n23\n]\n[\n24\n]\nThe basic way camera obscura works\nScientific Revolution\nFurther information:\nHistory of physics § Scientific Revolution\nPhysics became a separate science when\nearly modern Europeans\nused experimental and quantitative methods to discover what are now considered to be the\nlaws of physics\n.\n[\n25\n]\n[\npage needed\n]\nMajor developments in this period include the replacement of the\ngeocentric model\nof the\nSolar System\nwith the heliocentric\nCopernican model\n, the\nlaws governing the motion of planetary bodies\n(determined by\nJohannes Kepler\nbetween 1609 and 1619), Galileo's pioneering work on\ntelescopes\nand\nobservational astronomy\nin the 16th and 17th centuries, and\nIsaac Newton\n's discovery and unification of the\nlaws of motion\nand\nuniversal gravitation\n(that would come to bear his name).\n[\n26\n]\nNewton, and separately\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\n, developed\ncalculus\n,\n[\n27\n]\nthe mathematical study of continuous change, and Newton applied it to solve physical problems.\n[\n28\n]\nGalileo Galilei\n(1564–1642) related mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics.\nJohannes Kepler\n(1571–1630) explained\nplanetary motions\n, formulating the first \"natural laws\" in the modern sense\n[\n29\n]\nIsaac Newton\ndiscovered the\nlaws of motion\nand\nuniversal gravitation\n19th century\nFurther information:\nHistory of physics § 19th century\nThe discovery of laws in\nthermodynamics\n,\nchemistry\n, and\nelectromagnetics\nresulted from research efforts during the\nIndustrial Revolution\nas energy needs increased.\n[\n30\n]\nBy the end of the 19th century, theories of thermodynamics,\nmechanics\n, and electromagnetics matched a wide variety of observations. Taken together these theories became the basis for what would later be called\nclassical physics\n.\n[\n31\n]\n: 2\nA few experimental results remained inexplicable. Classical electromagnetism presumed a medium, an\nluminiferous aether\nto support the propagation of waves, but this medium could not be detected. The intensity of light from hot glowing\nblackbody\nobjects did not match the predictions of thermodynamics and electromagnetism. The character of\nelectron emission\nof illuminated metals differed from predictions. These failures, seemingly insignificant in the big picture would upset the physics world in first two decades of the 20th century.\n[\n31\n]\n20th century\nSee also:\nHistory of special relativity\nand\nHistory of quantum mechanics\nFurther information:\nHistory of physics § 20th century: birth of modern physics\nMax Planck\n(1858–1947), proposed\nquanta\nto explain the\nblackbody spectrum\n,\n[\n32\n]\noriginating\nquantum theory\n.\n[\n33\n]\n[\n34\n]\nAlbert Einstein\n(1879–1955), discovered the\nphotoelectric effect\nand\ntheory of relativity\n.\nModern physics\nbegan in the early 20th century with the work of\nMax Planck\nin quantum theory and\nAlbert Einstein\n's theory of relativity. Both of these theories came about due to inaccuracies in classical mechanics in certain situations.\nClassical mechanics\npredicted that the\nspeed of light\ndepends on the motion of the observer, which could not be resolved with the constant speed predicted by\nMaxwell's equations\nof electromagnetism. This discrepancy was corrected by Einstein's theory of\nspecial relativity\n, which replaced classical mechanics for fast-moving bodies and allowed for a constant speed of light.\n[\n35\n]\nBlack-body radiation\nprovided another problem for classical physics, which was corrected when Planck proposed that the excitation of material oscillators is possible only in discrete steps proportional to their frequency. This, along with the\nphotoelectric effect\nand a complete theory predicting discrete\nenergy levels\nof\nelectron orbitals\n, led to the theory of quantum mechanics improving on classical physics at very small scales.\n[\n36\n]\nQuantum mechanics would come to be pioneered by\nWerner Heisenberg\n,\nErwin Schrödinger\nand\nPaul Dirac\n.\n[\n36\n]\nFrom this early work, and work in related fields, the\nStandard Model of particle physics\nwas derived.\n[\n37\n]\nFollowing the discovery of a particle with properties consistent with the\nHiggs boson\nat\nCERN\nin 2012,\n[\n38\n]\nall\nfundamental particles\npredicted by the standard model, and no others, appear to exist; however,\nphysics beyond the Standard Model\n, with theories such as\nsupersymmetry\n, is an active area of research.\n[\n39\n]\nAreas of mathematics in general are important to this field, such as the study of\nprobabilities\nand\ngroups\n.\nCore theories\nFurther information:\nOutline of physics\nPhysics deals with a wide variety of systems, although certain theories are used by all physicists. Each of these theories was experimentally tested numerous times and found to be an adequate approximation of nature.\nThese central theories are important tools for research into more specialized topics, and any physicist, regardless of their specialization, is expected to be literate in them. These include classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and\nstatistical mechanics\n,\nelectromagnetism\n, and special relativity.\nDistinction between classical and modern physics\nFurther information:\nHistory of physics § Division into classical and modern\nClassical mechanics works for larger and slower objects; modern theories are needed otherwise.\nIn the first decades of the 20th century physics was revolutionized by the discoveries of quantum mechanics and relativity. The changes were so fundamental that these new concepts became the foundation of \"modern physics\", with other topics becoming \"classical physics\". The majority of applications of physics are essentially classical.\n[\n40\n]\n:\nxxxi\nThe laws of classical physics accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light.\n[\n40\n]\n: xxxii\nOutside of this domain, observations do not match predictions provided by classical mechanics.\n[\n31\n]\n: 6\nClassical theory\nMain article:\nClassical physics\nClassical physics includes the traditional branches and topics that were recognized and well-developed before the beginning of the 20th century—classical mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism.\n[\n31\n]\n:\n2\nClassical mechanics is concerned with bodies acted on by\nforces\nand bodies in\nmotion\nand may be divided into\nstatics\n(study of the forces on a body or bodies not subject to an acceleration),\nkinematics\n(study of motion without regard to its causes), and\ndynamics\n(study of motion and the forces that affect it); mechanics may also be divided into\nsolid mechanics\nand\nfluid mechanics\n(known together as\ncontinuum mechanics\n), the latter include such branches as\nhydrostatics\n,\nhydrodynamics\nand\npneumatics\n. Acoustics is the study of how sound is produced, controlled, transmitted and received.\n[\n41\n]\nImportant modern branches of acoustics include\nultrasonics\n, the study of sound waves of very high frequency beyond the range of human hearing;\nbioacoustics\n, the physics of animal calls and hearing;\n[\n42\n]\nand\nelectroacoustics\n, the manipulation of audible sound waves using electronics.\n[\n43\n]\nOptics, the study of light, is concerned not only with\nvisible light\nbut also with\ninfrared\nand\nultraviolet radiation\n, which exhibit all of the phenomena of visible light except visibility, e.g., reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion, and polarization of light. Heat is a form of energy, the internal energy possessed by the particles of which a substance is composed; thermodynamics deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy. Electricity and\nmagnetism\nhave been studied as a single branch of physics since the intimate connection between them was discovered in the early 19th century; an\nelectric current\ngives rise to a\nmagnetic field\n, and a changing magnetic field induces an electric current.\nElectrostatics\ndeals with\nelectric charges\nat rest,\nelectrodynamics\nwith moving charges, and\nmagnetostatics\nwith magnetic poles at rest.\nModern theory\nMain article:\nModern physics\nThe discovery of relativity and of quantum mechanics in the first decades of the 20th century transformed the conceptual basis of physics without reducing the practical value of most of the physical theories developed up to that time. Consequently the topics of physics have come to be divided into \"classical physics\" and \"modern physics\", with the latter category including effects related to quantum mechanics and relativity.\n[\n31\n]\n:\n2\nClassical physics is generally concerned with matter and energy on the normal scale of observation, while much of modern physics is concerned with the behavior of matter and energy under extreme conditions or on a very large or very small scale. For example,\natomic\nand\nnuclear physics\nstudy matter on the smallest scale at which\nchemical elements\ncan be identified. The\nphysics of elementary particles\nis on an even smaller scale since it is concerned with the most basic units of matter; this branch of physics is also known as high-energy physics because of the extremely high energies necessary to produce many types of particles in\nparticle accelerators\n. On this scale, ordinary, commonsensical notions of space, time, matter, and energy are no longer valid.\n[\n44\n]\nThe two chief theories of modern physics present a different picture of the concepts of space, time, and matter from that presented by classical physics. Classical mechanics approximates nature as continuous, while quantum theory is concerned with the discrete nature of many phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level and with the complementary aspects of particles and waves in the description of such phenomena. The theory of relativity is concerned with the description of phenomena that take place in a\nframe of reference\nthat is in motion with respect to an observer; the special theory of relativity is concerned with motion in the absence of gravitational fields and the\ngeneral theory of relativity\nwith motion and its connection with\ngravitation\n. Both quantum theory and the theory of relativity find applications in many areas of modern physics.\n[\n45\n]\nFundamental concepts in modern physics include:\nAction\nCausality\nCovariance\nParticle\nPhysical field\nPhysical interaction\nQuantum\nStatistical ensemble\nSymmetry\nWave\nResearch\nScientific method\nPhysicists use the scientific method to test the validity of a\nphysical theory\n. By using a methodical approach to compare the implications of a theory with the conclusions drawn from its related experiments and observations, physicists are better able to test the validity of a theory in a logical, unbiased, and repeatable way. To that end, experiments are performed and observations are made in order to determine the validity or invalidity of a\ntheory\n.\n[\n46\n]\nA scientific law is a concise verbal or mathematical statement of a relation that expresses a fundamental principle of some theory, such as Newton's law of universal gravitation.\n[\n47\n]\nTheory and experiment\nMain articles:\nTheoretical physics\nand\nExperimental physics\nThe\nastronaut\nand Earth are both in\nfree fall\n. (Pictured: Astronaut Bruce McCandless.)\nLightning\nis an\nelectric current\n.\nTheorists seek to develop\nmathematical models\nthat both agree with existing experiments and successfully predict future experimental results, while\nexperimentalists\ndevise and perform experiments to test theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena. Although\ntheory\nand experiment are developed separately, they strongly affect and depend upon each other. Progress in physics frequently comes about when experimental results defy explanation by existing theories, prompting intense focus on applicable modeling, and when new theories generate experimentally testable\npredictions\n, which inspire the development of new experiments (and often related equipment).\n[\n48\n]\nPhysicists\nwho work at the interplay of theory and experiment are called\nphenomenologists\n, who study complex phenomena observed in experiment and work to relate them to a\nfundamental theory\n.\n[\n49\n]\nTheoretical physics has historically taken inspiration from philosophy; electromagnetism was unified this way.\n[\nb\n]\nBeyond the known universe, the field of theoretical physics also deals with hypothetical issues,\n[\nc\n]\nsuch as\nparallel universes\n, a\nmultiverse\n, and\nhigher dimensions\n. Theorists invoke these ideas in hopes of solving particular problems with existing theories; they then explore the consequences of these ideas and work toward making testable predictions.\nExperimental physics expands, and is expanded by, engineering and technology. Experimental physicists who are involved in\nbasic research\ndesign and perform experiments with equipment such as particle accelerators and\nlasers\n, whereas those involved in\napplied research\noften work in industry, developing technologies such as\nmagnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) and\ntransistors\n.\nFeynman\nhas noted that experimentalists may seek areas that have not been explored well by theorists.\n[\n50\n]\nScope and aims\nPhysics involves modeling the natural world with theory, usually quantitative. Here, the path of a particle is modeled with the mathematics of\ncalculus\nto explain its behavior: the purview of the branch of physics known as\nmechanics\n.\nPhysics covers a wide range of\nphenomena\n, from\nelementary particles\n(such as\nquarks\n,\nneutrinos\n, and\nelectrons\n) to the largest\nsuperclusters\nof galaxies. Included in these phenomena are the most basic objects composing all other things. Therefore, physics is sometimes called the \"fundamental science\".\n[\n51\n]\nPhysics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena. Thus, physics aims to both connect the things observable to humans to root causes, and then connect these causes together.\nFor example, the\nancient Chinese\nobserved that certain rocks (\nlodestone\nand\nmagnetite\n) were attracted to one another by an invisible force. This effect was later called magnetism, which was first rigorously studied in the 17th century. But even before the Chinese discovered magnetism, the\nancient Greeks\nknew of other objects such as\namber\n, that when rubbed with fur would cause a similar invisible attraction between the two.\n[\n52\n]\nThis was also first studied rigorously in the 17th century and came to be called electricity. Thus, physics had come to understand two observations of nature in terms of some root cause (electricity and magnetism). However, further work in the 19th century revealed that these two forces were just two different aspects of one force—\nelectromagnetism\n. This process of \"unifying\" forces continues today, and electromagnetism and the\nweak nuclear force\nare now considered to be two aspects of the\nelectroweak interaction\n. Physics hopes to find an ultimate reason (theory of everything) for why nature is as it is (see section\nCurrent research\nbelow for more information).\n[\n53\n]\nCurrent research\nFurther information:\nList of unsolved problems in physics\nFeynman diagram\nsigned by\nR. P. Feynman\nA typical phenomenon described by physics: a\nmagnet\nlevitating above a\nsuperconductor\ndemonstrates the\nMeissner effect\n.\nResearch in physics is continually progressing on a large number of fronts.\nIn condensed matter physics, an important unsolved theoretical problem is that of\nhigh-temperature superconductivity\n.\n[\n54\n]\nMany condensed matter experiments are aiming to fabricate workable\nspintronics\nand\nquantum computers\n.\n[\n55\n]\n[\n56\n]\nIn particle physics, the first pieces of experimental evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model have begun to appear. Foremost among these are indications that\nneutrinos\nhave non-zero\nmass\n. These experimental results appear to have solved the long-standing\nsolar neutrino problem\n, and the physics of massive neutrinos remains an area of active theoretical and experimental research. The Large Hadron Collider has already found the Higgs boson, but future research aims to prove or disprove the\nsupersymmetry\n, which extends the Standard Model of particle physics. Research on the nature of the major mysteries of dark matter and\ndark energy\nis also currently ongoing.\n[\n57\n]\nAlthough much progress has been made in high-energy,\nquantum\n, and astronomical physics, many everyday phenomena involving\ncomplexity\n,\n[\n58\n]\nchaos,\n[\n59\n]\nor\nturbulence\n[\n60\n]\nare still poorly understood. Complex problems that seem like they could be solved by a clever application of dynamics and mechanics remain unsolved; examples include the formation of sandpiles, nodes in trickling water, the shape of water droplets, mechanisms of\nsurface tension\ncatastrophes\n, and self-sorting in shaken heterogeneous collections.\n[\nd\n]\n[\n61\n]\nThese complex phenomena have received growing attention since the 1970s for several reasons, including the availability of modern mathematical methods and computers, which enabled\ncomplex systems\nto be modeled in new ways. Complex physics has become part of increasingly interdisciplinary research, as exemplified by the study of turbulence in aerodynamics and the observation of\npattern formation\nin biological systems. In the 1932\nAnnual Review of Fluid Mechanics\n,\nHorace Lamb\nsaid:\n[\n62\n]\nI am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the former I am rather optimistic.\nBranches and fields\nThis section is an excerpt from\nBranches of physics\n.\n[\nedit\n]\nBranches of physics include classical\nmechanics\n;\nthermodynamics\nand\nstatistical mechanics\n;\nelectromagnetism\nand\nphotonics\n; relativity;\nquantum mechanics\n,\natomic physics\n, and\nmolecular physics\n;\noptics\nand acoustics; condensed matter physics; high-energy particle physics and nuclear physics; and\nchaos theory\nand cosmology; and interdisciplinary fields.\nFields\nThe major fields of physics, along with their subfields and the theories and concepts they employ, are shown in the following table.\nField\nSubfields\nMajor theories\nConcepts\nNuclear\nand\nparticle physics\nNuclear physics\n,\nNuclear astrophysics\n,\nParticle physics\n,\nAstroparticle physics\n,\nParticle physics phenomenology\nStandard Model\n,\nQuantum field theory\n,\nQuantum electrodynamics\n,\nQuantum chromodynamics\n,\nElectroweak theory\n,\nEffective field theory\n,\nLattice field theory\n,\nGauge theory\n,\nSupersymmetry\n,\nGrand Unified Theory\n,\nSuperstring theory\n,\nM-theory\n,\nAdS/CFT correspondence\nFundamental interaction\n(\ngravitational\n,\nelectromagnetic\n,\nweak\n,\nstrong\n),\nElementary particle\n,\nSpin\n,\nAntimatter\n,\nSpontaneous symmetry breaking\n,\nNeutrino oscillation\n,\nSeesaw mechanism\n,\nBrane\n,\nString\n,\nQuantum gravity\n,\nTheory of everything\n,\nVacuum energy\nAtomic, molecular, and optical physics\nAtomic physics\n,\nMolecular physics\n,\nAtomic and molecular astrophysics\n,\nChemical physics\n,\nOptics\n,\nPhotonics\nQuantum optics\n,\nQuantum chemistry\n,\nQuantum information science\nPhoton\n,\nAtom\n,\nMolecule\n,\nDiffraction\n,\nElectromagnetic radiation\n,\nLaser\n,\nPolarization (waves)\n,\nSpectral line\n,\nCasimir effect\nCondensed matter physics\nSolid-state physics\n,\nHigh-pressure physics\n,\nLow-temperature physics\n,\nSurface physics\n,\nNanoscale and mesoscopic physics\n,\nPolymer physics\nBCS theory\n,\nBloch's theorem\n,\nDensity functional theory\n,\nFermi gas\n,\nFermi liquid theory\n,\nMany-body theory\n,\nStatistical mechanics\nPhases\n(\ngas\n,\nliquid\n,\nsolid\n),\nBose–Einstein condensate\n,\nElectrical conduction\n,\nPhonon\n,\nMagnetism\n,\nSelf-organization\n,\nSemiconductor\n,\nsuperconductor\n,\nsuperfluidity\n,\nSpin\nAstrophysics\nAstronomy\n,\nAstrometry\n,\nCosmology\n,\nGravitation physics\n,\nHigh-energy astrophysics\n,\nPlanetary astrophysics\n,\nPlasma physics\n,\nSolar physics\n,\nSpace physics\n,\nStellar astrophysics\nBig Bang\n,\nCosmic inflation\n,\nGeneral relativity\n,\nNewton's law of universal gravitation\n,\nLambda-CDM model\n,\nMagnetohydrodynamics\nBlack hole\n,\nCosmic background radiation\n,\nCosmic string\n,\nCosmos\n,\nDark energy\n,\nDark matter\n,\nGalaxy\n,\nGravity\n,\nGravitational radiation\n,\nGravitational singularity\n,\nPlanet\n,\nSolar System\n,\nStar\n,\nSupernova\n,\nUniverse\nApplied physics\nAccelerator physics\n,\nAcoustics\n,\nAgrophysics\n,\nAtmospheric physics\n,\nBiophysics\n,\nChemical physics\n,\nCommunication physics\n,\nEconophysics\n,\nEngineering physics\n,\nFluid dynamics\n,\nGeophysics\n,\nLaser physics\n,\nMaterials physics\n,\nMedical physics\n,\nNanotechnology\n,\nOptics\n,\nOptoelectronics\n,\nPhotonics\n,\nPhotovoltaics\n,\nPhysical chemistry\n,\nPhysical oceanography\n,\nPhysics of computation\n,\nPlasma physics\n,\nSolid-state devices\n,\nQuantum chemistry\n,\nQuantum electronics\n,\nQuantum information science\n,\nVehicle dynamics\nSince the 20th century, the individual fields of physics have become increasingly specialized, and today most physicists work in a single field for their entire careers. \"Universalists\" such as Einstein (1879–1955) and\nLev Landau\n(1908–1968), who worked in multiple fields of physics, are now very rare.\n[\ne\n]\nContemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into\nnuclear\nand\nparticle physics\n;\ncondensed matter physics\n;\natomic, molecular, and optical physics\n;\nastrophysics\n; and applied physics.

The three areas are grouped together because of their interrelationships, the similarity of methods used, and the commonality of their relevant energy scales. All three areas include both classical, semi-classical and\nquantum\ntreatments; they can treat their subject from a microscopic view (in contrast to a macroscopic view).\nAtomic physics studies the\nelectron shells\nof atoms.

Historically, condensed matter physics grew out of solid-state physics, which is now considered one of its main subfields.\n[\n82\n]\nThe term\ncondensed matter physics\nwas apparently coined by\nPhilip Anderson\nwhen he renamed his research group—previously\nsolid-state theory\n—in 1967.\n[\n83\n]\nIn 1978, the Division of Solid State Physics of the\nAmerican Physical Society\nwas renamed as the Division of Condensed Matter Physics.\n[\n82\n]\nCondensed matter physics has a large overlap with chemistry,\nmaterials science\n,\nnanotechnology\nand engineering.\n[\n55\n]\nAstrophysics\nMain articles:\nAstrophysics\nand\nPhysical cosmology\nThe deepest visible-light image of the\nuniverse\n, the\nHubble Ultra-Deep Field\n. The vast majority of objects seen above are distant galaxies.\nAstrophysics and astronomy are the application of the theories and methods of physics to the study of\nstellar structure\n,\nstellar evolution\n, the origin of the Solar System, and related problems of cosmology. Because astrophysics is a broad subject, astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.\n[\n84\n]\nThe discovery by\nKarl Jansky\nin 1931 that radio signals were emitted by celestial bodies initiated the science of\nradio astronomy\n. Most recently, the frontiers of astronomy have been expanded by space exploration. Perturbations and interference from the Earth's atmosphere make space-based observations necessary for\ninfrared\n,\nultraviolet\n,\ngamma-ray\n, and\nX-ray astronomy\n.\nPhysical cosmology is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe on its largest scales. Albert Einstein's theory of relativity plays a central role in all modern cosmological theories. In the early 20th century,\nHubble\n's discovery that the universe is expanding, as shown by the\nHubble diagram\n, prompted rival explanations known as the\nsteady state\nuniverse and the\nBig Bang\n.\nThe Big Bang was confirmed by the success of\nBig Bang nucleosynthesis\nand the discovery of the\ncosmic microwave background\nin 1964. The Big Bang model rests on two theoretical pillars: Albert Einstein's general relativity and the\ncosmological principle\n. Cosmologists have recently established the\nΛCDM model\nof the evolution of the universe, which includes\ncosmic inflation\n,\ndark energy\n, and\ndark matter\n.\nOther aspects\nEducation\nThis section is an excerpt from\nPhysics education\n.\n[\nedit\n]\nAn Atwood's machine is a machine consisting of a pulley and two masses that is commonly used in physics classrooms to demonstrate Newton's laws of motion\nPhysics education\nor physics teaching refers to the\neducation\nmethods currently used to\nteach\nphysics. The occupation is called physics educator or physics teacher.\nPhysics education research\nrefers to an area of pedagogical research that seeks to improve those methods. Historically, physics has been taught at the high school and college level primarily by the lecture method together with laboratory exercises aimed at verifying concepts taught in the lectures. These concepts are better understood when lectures are accompanied with demonstration, hand-on experiments, and questions that require students to ponder what will happen in an experiment and why. Students who participate in\nactive learning\nfor example with hands-on experiments learn through self-discovery. By trial and error they learn to change their preconceptions about phenomena in physics and discover the underlying concepts. Physics education is part of the broader area of\nscience education\n.\nCareers\nThis section is an excerpt from\nPhysicist\n.\n[\nedit\n]\nA\nphysicist\nis a\nscientist\nwho specializes in the field of physics, which encompasses the interactions of matter and energy at all length and time scales in the physical universe.\n[\n85\n]\n[\n86\n]\nPhysicists generally are interested in the root or ultimate causes of\nphenomena\n, and usually frame their understanding in mathematical terms. They work across a wide range of\nresearch fields\n, spanning all length scales: from\nsub-atomic\nand\nparticle physics\n, through\nbiological physics\n, to\ncosmological\nlength scales encompassing the\nuniverse\nas a whole. The field generally includes two types of physicists:\nexperimental physicists\nwho specialize in the observation of natural phenomena and the development and analysis of experiments, and\ntheoretical physicists\nwho specialize in mathematical modeling of physical systems to rationalize, explain and predict natural phenomena.\n[\n85\n]\nPhysicists can apply their knowledge towards solving practical problems or to developing new technologies (also known as\napplied physics\nor\nengineering physics\n).\n[\n87\n]\n[\n88\n]\n[\n89\n]\nPhilosophy\nMain article:\nPhilosophy of physics\nPhysics, as with the rest of science, relies on the\nphilosophy of science\nand its \"\nscientific method\n\" to advance knowledge of the physical world.\n[\n90\n]\nThe scientific method employs\na priori and a posteriori\nreasoning as well as the use of\nBayesian inference\nto measure the validity of a given theory.\n[\n91\n]\nStudy of the philosophical issues surrounding physics, the\nphilosophy of physics\n, involves issues such as the nature of\nspace and time\n,\ndeterminism\n, and\nmetaphysical\noutlooks such as\nempiricism\n,\nnaturalism\n, and\nrealism\n.\n[\n92\n]\nMany physicists have written about the philosophical implications of their work, for instance\nLaplace\n, who championed\ncausal determinism\n,\n[\n93\n]\nand\nErwin Schrödinger\n, who wrote on quantum mechanics.\n[\n94\n]\n[\n95\n]\nThe mathematical physicist\nRoger Penrose\nhas been called a\nPlatonist\nby\nStephen Hawking\n,\n[\n96\n]\na view Penrose discusses in his book,\nThe Road to Reality\n.\n[\n97\n]\nHawking referred to himself as an \"unashamed reductionist\" and took issue with Penrose's views.\n[\n98\n]\nThis\nparabola\n-shaped\nlava flow\nillustrates an application of mathematics in physics — in this case, Galileo's\nlaw of falling bodies\n.\nMathematics and ontology are used in physics. Physics is used in chemistry and\ncosmology\n.\nMathematics provides a compact and exact language used to describe the order in nature. This was noted and advocated by\nPythagoras\n,\n[\n99\n]\nPlato\n,\n[\n100\n]\nGalileo,\n[\n101\n]\nand Newton. Some theorists, like\nHilary Putnam\nand\nPenelope Maddy\n, hold that logical truths, and therefore mathematical reasoning, depend on the\nempirical\nworld. This is usually combined with the claim that the laws of logic express universal regularities found in the structural features of the world, which may explain the peculiar relation between these fields.\nPhysics uses mathematics\n[\n102\n]\nto organize and formulate experimental results. From those results,\nprecise\nor\nestimated\nsolutions are obtained, or quantitative results, from which new predictions can be made and experimentally confirmed or negated. The results from physics experiments are numerical data, with their\nunits of measure\nand estimates of the errors in the measurements. Technologies based on mathematics, like\ncomputation\nhave made\ncomputational physics\nan active area of research.\nThe distinction between mathematics and physics is clear-cut, but not always obvious, especially in mathematical physics.\nOntology\nis a prerequisite for physics, but not for mathematics. It means physics is ultimately concerned with descriptions of the real world, while mathematics is concerned with abstract patterns, even beyond the real world. Thus physics statements are synthetic, while mathematical statements are analytic. Mathematics contains hypotheses, while physics contains theories. Mathematics statements have to be only logically true, while predictions of physics statements must match observed and experimental data.\nThe distinction is clear-cut, but not always obvious. For example,\nmathematical physics\nis the application of mathematics in physics. Its methods are mathematical, but its subject is physical.\n[\n103\n]\nThe problems in this field start with a \"\nmathematical model of a physical situation\n\" (system) and a \"mathematical description of a physical law\" that will be applied to that system. Every mathematical statement used for solving has a hard-to-find physical meaning. The final mathematical solution has an easier-to-find meaning, because it is what the solver is looking for.\n[\nclarification needed\n]\nFundamental vs. applied physics\nMain article:\nApplied physics\nPhysics is a branch of\nfundamental science\n(also called basic science). Physics is also called \"\nthe\nfundamental science\" because all branches of natural science including chemistry, astronomy, geology, and biology are constrained by laws of physics.\n[\n51\n]\nSimilarly, chemistry is often called\nthe central science\nbecause of its role in linking the physical sciences. For example, chemistry studies properties, structures, and\nreactions\nof matter (chemistry's focus on the molecular and atomic scale\ndistinguishes it from physics\n). Structures are formed because particles exert electrical forces on each other, properties include physical characteristics of given substances, and reactions are bound by laws of physics, like\nconservation of energy\n,\nmass\n, and\ncharge\n. Fundamental physics seeks to better explain and understand phenomena in all spheres, without a specific practical application as a goal, other than the deeper insight into the phenomema themselves.\nAn\nacoustic engineering\nmodel of sound reflecting from an acoustic diffuser, implemented with classical physics\nArchimedes' screw\n, a\nsimple machine\nfor lifting\nApplied physics is a general term for physics research and development that is intended for a particular use. An applied physics curriculum usually contains a few classes in an applied discipline, like geology or electrical engineering. It usually differs from engineering in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem.\nThe approach is similar to that of\napplied mathematics\n. Applied physicists use physics in scientific research. For instance, people working on\naccelerator physics\nmight seek to build better\nparticle detectors\nfor research in theoretical physics.\nPhysics is used heavily in engineering. For example, statics, a subfield of\nmechanics\n, is used in the building of bridges and other static structures. The understanding and use of acoustics results in sound control and better concert halls; similarly, the use of optics creates better optical devices. An understanding of physics makes for more realistic\nflight simulators\n, video games, and movies, and is often critical in\nforensic\ninvestigations.\nExperiment using a\nlaser\nWith the\nstandard consensus\nthat the\nlaws\nof physics are universal and do not change with time, physics can be used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in\nuncertainty\n. For example, in the study of the origin of the Earth, a physicist can reasonably model Earth's mass, temperature, and rate of rotation, as a function of time allowing the extrapolation forward or backward in time and so predict future or prior events. It also allows for simulations in engineering that speed up the development of a new technology.\nThere is also considerable\ninterdisciplinarity\n, so many other important fields are influenced by physics (e.g., the fields of\neconophysics\nand\nsociophysics\n).\nSee also\nPhysics portal\nEarth science\n– Fields of natural science related to Earth\nNeurophysics\n– Study of the nervous system with physics\nPsychophysics\n– Branch of knowledge relating physical stimuli and psychological perception\nRelationship between mathematics and physics\nScience tourism\n– Travel to notable science locations\nLists\nList of important publications in physics\nList of physicists\nLists of physics equations\nNotes\n^\nInformation regarding the images in the footer was trimmed, the full descriptions are below:\nMechanics\n: a photo of a\nNewton's cradle\n, which, when in motion, demonstrates the\nconservation laws\nof\nmomentum\nand\nenergy\nin classical mechanics.\nThermodynamics\n: two photographs comparing a\nsnowflake\nbefore (left) and after (right)\nmelting\n, illustrating the increase in\nentropy\nthrough the visible loss of structural\norder\nand morphological specificity, thereby widening the range of possible microstates (i.e.\nS = k ln W\n).\nWaves\n,\nOscillations\n&\nAcoustics\n: perturbations propagating through a\nChladni plate\n, forming\nstanding wave\npatterns where\nresonance\ncauses the sand on the plate to arrange in geometric figures.\nElectromagnetism\n&\nGeophysics\n: the\naurora borealis\n, a natural phenomenon involving\ncharged particles\n' behaviour in the Earth's\nmagnetosphere\n.\nFluid mechanics\n&\nBiophysics\n: a water strider using the\nsurface tension\nof water to float across a pond.\nAstrophysics\n,\nRelativity\n&\nOptics\n: an\nastrophotograph\ndistorted by\ngravitational lensing\n, a relativistic effect in which immense gravitational environments influence the motion of\nphotons\n.\nQuantum mechanics\n: a diagrammatic representation of the\ndouble‑slit experiment\n, illustrating\nwave‑particle duality\n.

For example, the\natom\nof nineteenth-century physics was denigrated by some, including\nErnst Mach\n's critique of\nLudwig Boltzmann\n's formulation of\nstatistical mechanics\n. By the end of World War II, the atom was no longer deemed hypothetical.\n^\nSee the work of\nIlya Prigogine\n, on 'systems far from equilibrium', and others.\n^\nYet, universalism is encouraged in the culture of physics. For example, the\nWorld Wide Web\n, which was innovated at\nCERN\nby\nTim Berners-Lee\n, was created in service to the computer infrastructure of CERN, and was/is intended for use by physicists worldwide.

This\nbeam engine\nis on display in the\nTechnical University of Madrid\n.\nEngineering\nis the practice of using\nnatural science\n,\nmathematics\n, and the\nengineering design process\n[\n1\n]\nto\nsolve problems\nwithin\ntechnology\n, increase\nefficiency\nand\nproductivity\n, and improve\nsystems\n. The traditional disciplines of engineering are\ncivil\n,\nmechanical\n,\nelectrical\n, and\nchemical\n. The\nacademic discipline\nof engineering encompasses a broad range of more\nspecialized\nsubfields, and each can have a more specific emphasis for applications of\nmathematics\nand\nscience\n. In turn, modern engineering practice spans multiple\nfields of engineering\n, which include\ndesigning\nand improving\ninfrastructure\n,\nmachinery\n,\nvehicles\n,\nelectronics\n,\nmaterials\n, and\nenergy systems\n.\n[\n2\n]\nFor related terms, see\nglossary of engineering\n.\nAs a human endeavor, engineering has existed since ancient times, starting with the six classic\nsimple machines\n. Examples of large-scale engineering projects from antiquity include impressive structures like the\npyramids\n, elegant temples such as the\nParthenon\n, and water conveyances like\nhulled watercraft\n,\ncanals\n, and the\nRoman aqueduct\n. Early machines were powered by humans and animals, then later by wind. Machines of war were invented for\nsiegecraft\n. In Europe, the\nscientific\nand\nindustrial revolutions\nadvanced engineering into a scientific profession and resulted in continuing technological improvements. The\nsteam engine\nprovided much greater power than animals, leading to mechanical propulsion for ships and railways. Further scientific advances resulted in the application of engineering to electrical, chemical, and\naerospace\nrequirements, plus the use of new materials for greater efficiencies.\nThe word\nengineering\nis derived from the\nLatin\ningenium\n.\n[\n3\n]\nEngineers typically follow a code of ethics that favors honesty and integrity, while being dedicated to public\nsafety\nand\nwelfare\n. Engineering tasks involve finding\noptimal solutions\nbased on constraints, with testing and\nsimulations\nbeing used prior to production. When a deployed product fails,\nforensic engineering\nis used to determine what went wrong in order to find a fix. Much of this\nproduct lifecycle management\nis now assisted with computer\nsoftware\n, from\ndesign\nto\ntesting\nand\nmanufacturing\n. At larger scales, this process normally funded by a company, multiple investors, or the government, so a knowledge of economics and business practices is needed.\nDefinition\nThe\nAmerican Engineers' Council for Professional Development\n(the predecessor of the\nAccreditation Board for Engineering and Technology\naka ABET)\n[\n4\n]\nhas defined \"engineering\" as:\nThe creative application of scientific principles to design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, or\nmanufacturing\nprocesses, or works utilizing them singly or in combination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their behavior under specific operating conditions; all as respects an intended\nfunction\n, economics of operation and\nsafety\nto life and property.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n6\n]\nHistory\nMain article:\nHistory of engineering\nRelief map\nof the\nCitadel of Lille\n, designed in 1668 by\nVauban\n, the foremost military engineer of his age\nEngineering has existed since ancient times, when\nhumans\ndevised inventions such as the\nwedge\n,\nlever\n,\nwheel\nand\npulley\n, etc.\n[\n7\n]\nThe term\nengineering\nis derived from the word\nengineer\n, which itself dates back to the 14th century when an\nengine'er\n(literally, one who builds or operates a\nsiege engine\n) referred to \"a constructor of military engines\".\n[\n8\n]\nIn this context, now obsolete, an \"engine\" referred to a military machine,\ni.e.\n, a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a\ncatapult\n).\n[\n9\n]\nNotable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps,\ne.g.\n, the\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers\n.\nThe word \"engine\" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the Latin\ningenium\n(\nc.\n1250\n), meaning \"innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention.\"\n[\n10\n]\nLater, as the design of civilian structures, such as bridges and buildings, matured as a technical discipline, the term\ncivil engineering\n[\n6\n]\nentered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the discipline of\nmilitary engineering\n.\nAncient era\nThe Ancient Romans built\naqueducts\nto bring a steady supply of clean and fresh water to cities and towns in the empire.\n[\n11\n]\nThe\npyramids\nin\nancient Egypt\n,\nziggurats\nof\nMesopotamia\n, the\nAcropolis\nand\nParthenon\nin\nGreece\n, the\nRoman aqueducts\n,\n[\n11\n]\nVia Appia\nand\nColosseum\n,\nTeotihuacán\n, and the\nBrihadeeswarar Temple\nof\nThanjavur\n, among many others, stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of ancient civil and military engineers. Other monuments, no longer standing, such as the\nHanging Gardens of Babylon\nand the\nPharos of Alexandria\n, were important engineering achievements of their time and were considered among the\nSeven Wonders of the Ancient World\n.\n[\n12\n]\nThe six classic\nsimple machines\nwere known in the\nancient Near East\n. The\nwedge\nand the\ninclined plane\n(ramp) were known since\nprehistoric\ntimes.\n[\n13\n]\nThe\nwheel\n, along with the\nwheel and axle\nmechanism, was invented in\nMesopotamia\n(modern Iraq) during the 5th millennium BC.\n[\n14\n]\nThe\nlever\nmechanism first appeared around 5,000 years ago in the\nNear East\n, where it was used in a simple\nbalance scale\n,\n[\n15\n]\nand to move large objects in\nancient Egyptian technology\n.\n[\n16\n]\nThe lever was also used in the\nshadoof\nwater-lifting device, the first\ncrane\nmachine, which appeared in Mesopotamia\nc.\n3000 BC\n,\n[\n15\n]\nand then in\nancient Egyptian technology\nc.\n2000 BC\n.\n[\n17\n]\nThe earliest evidence of\npulleys\ndate back to Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC,\n[\n18\n]\nand\nancient Egypt\nduring the\nTwelfth Dynasty\n(1991–1802 BC).\n[\n19\n]\nThe\nscrew\n, the last of the simple machines to be invented,\n[\n20\n]\nfirst appeared in Mesopotamia during the\nNeo-Assyrian\nperiod (911–609) BC.\n[\n18\n]\nThe\nEgyptian pyramids\nwere built using three of the six simple machines, the inclined plane, the wedge, and the lever, to create structures like the\nGreat Pyramid of Giza\n.\n[\n21\n]\nThe earliest civil engineer known by name is\nImhotep\n.\n[\n6\n]\nAs one of the officials of the\nPharaoh\n,\nDjosèr\n, he probably designed and supervised the construction of the\nPyramid of Djoser\n(the\nStep Pyramid\n) at\nSaqqara\nin Egypt around 2630–2611 BC.\n[\n22\n]\nThe earliest practical\nwater-powered\nmachines, the\nwater wheel\nand\nwatermill\n, first appeared in the\nPersian Empire\n, in what are now Iraq and Iran, by the early 4th century BC.\n[\n23\n]\nKush\ndeveloped the\nSakia\nduring the 4th century BC, which relied on animal power instead of human energy.\n[\n24\n]\nHafirs\nwere developed as a type of\nreservoir\nin Kush to store and contain water as well as boost irrigation.\n[\n25\n]\nKushite ancestors built\nspeos\nduring the Bronze Age between 3700 and 3250 BC.\n[\n26\n]\nBloomeries\nand\nblast furnaces\nwere also created during the 7th centuries BC in Kush.\n[\n27\n]\n[\n28\n]\n[\n29\n]\n[\n30\n]\nWooden plank-built seafaring ships were being engineered and built during the Bronze Age, as evidenced by the\nUluburun shipwreck\n, dated from around 1300 BCE.\n[\n31\n]\nAncient Greece\ndeveloped machines in both civilian and military domains, as evidenced by the writings of\nPhilo of Byzantium\nand others.\n[\n32\n]\nThe\nAntikythera mechanism\n, an early known mechanical\nanalog computer\n,\n[\n33\n]\n[\n34\n]\nand the mechanical\ninventions\nof\nArchimedes\n, are examples of Greek mechanical engineering. Some of Archimedes' inventions, as well as the Antikythera mechanism, required sophisticated knowledge of\ndifferential gearing\nor\nepicyclic gearing\n, two key principles in machine theory that helped design the\ngear trains\nof the Industrial Revolution, and are widely used in fields such as\nrobotics\nand\nautomotive engineering\n.\n[\n35\n]\nAncient Chinese, Greek, Roman and\nHunnic\narmies employed military machines and inventions such as\nartillery\nwhich was developed by the Greeks around the 4th century BC,\n[\n36\n]\nthe\ntrireme\n, the\nballista\nand the\ncatapult\n, the\ntrebuchet\nby Chinese circa 6th-5th century BCE.\n[\n37\n]\nMiddle Ages\nThe earliest practical\nwind-powered\nmachines, the\nwindmill\nand\nwind pump\n, first appeared in the\nMuslim world\nduring the\nIslamic Golden Age\n, in what are now Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, by the 9th century AD.\n[\n38\n]\n[\n39\n]\n[\n40\n]\n[\n41\n]\nThe earliest practical\nsteam-powered\nmachine was a\nsteam jack\ndriven by a\nsteam turbine\n, described in 1551 by\nTaqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf\nin\nOttoman Egypt\n.\n[\n42\n]\n[\n43\n]\nThe\ncotton gin\nwas invented in India by the 6th century AD,\n[\n44\n]\nand the\nspinning wheel\nwas invented in the\nIslamic world\nby the early 11th century,\n[\n45\n]\nboth of which were fundamental to the growth of the\ncotton industry\n. The spinning wheel was also a precursor to the\nspinning jenny\n, which was a key development during the early\nIndustrial Revolution\nin the 18th century.\n[\n46\n]\nThe earliest\nprogrammable machines\nwere developed in the Muslim world. A\nmusic sequencer\n, a programmable\nmusical instrument\n, was the earliest type of programmable machine. The first music sequencer was an automated\nflute\nplayer invented by the\nBanu Musa\nbrothers, described in their\nBook of Ingenious Devices\n, in the 9th century.\n[\n47\n]\n[\n48\n]\nIn 1206, Al-Jazari invented programmable\nautomata\n/\nrobots\n. He described four\nautomaton\nmusicians, including drummers operated by a programmable\ndrum machine\n, where they could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns.\n[\n49\n]\nA water-powered\nmine hoist\nused for raising ore, Germany,\nc.\n1556\nBefore the development of modern engineering, mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen, such as\nmillwrights\n,\nclockmakers\n, instrument makers and surveyors. Aside from these professions, universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology.\n[\n50\n]\n: 32\nA standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise\nDe re metallica\n(1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining, and chemistry.\nDe re metallica\nwas the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.\n[\n50\n]\nIndustrial revolution\nThe application of the steam engine allowed coke to be substituted for charcoal in\niron\nmaking, lowering the cost of iron, which provided engineers with a new material for building bridges. This bridge was made of\ncast iron\n, which was soon displaced by less brittle\nwrought iron\nas a structural material.\nThe science of\nclassical mechanics\n, sometimes called Newtonian mechanics, formed the scientific basis of much of modern engineering.\n[\n50\n]\nWith the rise of engineering as a\nprofession\nin the 18th century, the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends. Similarly, in addition to military and civil engineering, the fields then known as the\nmechanic arts\nbecame incorporated into engineering.\nCanal\nbuilding was an important engineering work during the early phases of the\nIndustrial Revolution\n.\n[\n51\n]\nJohn Smeaton\nwas the first self-proclaimed civil engineer and is often regarded as the \"father\" of civil engineering. He was an English civil engineer responsible for the design of\nbridges\n, canals,\nharbors\n, and\nlighthouses\n. He was also a capable\nmechanical engineer\nand an eminent\nphysicist\n. Using a model water wheel, Smeaton conducted experiments for seven years, determining ways to increase efficiency.\n[\n52\n]\n: 127\nSmeaton introduced iron axles and gears to water wheels.\n[\n50\n]\n: 69\nSmeaton also made mechanical improvements to the\nNewcomen steam engine\n. Smeaton designed the third\nEddystone Lighthouse\n(1755–59) where he pioneered the use of '\nhydraulic lime\n' (a form of\nmortar\nwhich will set under water) and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse. He is important in the history, rediscovery of, and development of modern\ncement\n, because he identified the compositional requirements needed to obtain \"hydraulicity\" in lime; work which led ultimately to the invention of\nPortland cement\n.\nApplied science led to the development of the steam engine. The sequence of events began with the invention of the\nbarometer\nand the measurement of atmospheric pressure by\nEvangelista Torricelli\nin 1643, demonstration of the force of atmospheric pressure by\nOtto von Guericke\nusing the\nMagdeburg hemispheres\nin 1656, laboratory experiments by\nDenis Papin\n, who built experimental model steam engines and demonstrated the use of a\npiston\n, which he published in 1707.\nEdward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester\npublished a book of 100 inventions containing a method for raising waters similar to a\ncoffee percolator\n.\nSamuel Morland\n, a mathematician and inventor who worked on\npumps\n, left notes at the Vauxhall Ordinance Office on a steam pump design that\nThomas Savery\nread. In 1698 Savery built a steam pump called \"The Miner's Friend\". It employed both vacuum and pressure.\n[\n53\n]\nIron merchant\nThomas Newcomen\n, who built the first commercial piston steam engine in 1712, was not known to have any scientific training.\n[\n52\n]\n: 32\nJumbo Jet\nThe application of steam-powered cast iron blowing cylinders for providing pressurized air for\nblast furnaces\nlead to a large increase in iron production in the late 18th century. The higher furnace temperatures made possible with steam-powered blast allowed for the use of more lime in\nblast furnaces\n, which enabled the transition from charcoal to\ncoke\n.\n[\n54\n]\nThese innovations lowered the cost of iron, making\nhorse railways\nand iron bridges practical. The\npuddling process\n, patented by\nHenry Cort\nin 1784 produced large scale quantities of wrought iron.\nHot blast\n, patented by\nJames Beaumont Neilson\nin 1828, greatly lowered the amount of fuel needed to smelt iron. With the development of the high pressure steam engine, the power to weight ratio of steam engines made practical steamboats and locomotives possible.\n[\n55\n]\nNew steel making processes, such as the\nBessemer process\nand the open hearth furnace, ushered in an area of heavy engineering in the late 19th century.\nOne of the most famous engineers of the mid-19th century was\nIsambard Kingdom Brunel\n, who built railroads, dockyards and steamships.\n[\n56\n]\nOther engineering luminaries of this period include\nNikola Tesla\n, prolific inventor of electrical applications;\n[\n57\n]\nAlexander Graham Bell\n, inventor of the first practical\ntelephone\n;\n[\n58\n]\nGeorge Stephenson\n, pioneer of railway transportation;\n[\n59\n]\nand\nNicolaus Otto\n, the designer of the first modern\ninternal combustion engine\n.\n[\n60\n]\nOffshore platform,\nGulf of Mexico\nThe\nIndustrial Revolution\ncreated a demand for machinery with metal parts, which led to the development of several\nmachine tools\n. Boring cast iron cylinders with precision was not possible until\nJohn Wilkinson\ninvented his\nboring machine\n, which is considered the first\nmachine tool\n.\n[\n61\n]\nOther machine tools included the\nscrew cutting lathe\n,\nmilling machine\n,\nturret lathe\nand the\nmetal planer\n. Precision machining techniques were developed in the first half of the 19th century. These included the use of gigs to guide the machining tool over the work and fixtures to hold the work in the proper position. Machine tools and machining techniques capable of producing\ninterchangeable parts\nlead to\nlarge scale factory production\nby the late 19th century.\n[\n62\n]\nDevelopment of new fields\nThe United States Census of 1850 listed the occupation of \"engineer\" for the first time with a count of 2,000.\n[\n63\n]\nThere were fewer than 50 engineering graduates in the U.S. before 1865. The first\nPhD\nin engineering (technically,\napplied science and engineering\n) awarded in the United States went to\nJosiah Willard Gibbs\nat\nYale University\nin 1863; it was also the second PhD awarded in science in the U.S.\n[\n64\n]\nIn 1870 there were a dozen U.S. mechanical engineering graduates, with that number increasing to 43 per year in 1875. In 1890, there were 6,000 engineers in civil,\nmining\n, mechanical and electrical.\n[\n55\n]\nThere was no chair of applied mechanism and applied mechanics at Cambridge until 1875, and no chair of engineering at Oxford until 1907. Germany established technical universities earlier.\n[\n65\n]\nThe foundations of\nelectrical engineering\nin the 1800s included the experiments of\nAlessandro Volta\n,\nMichael Faraday\n,\nGeorg Ohm\nand others and the invention of the\nelectric telegraph\nin 1816 and the\nelectric motor\nin 1872. The theoretical work of\nJames Maxwell\n(see:\nMaxwell's equations\n) and\nHeinrich Hertz\nin the late 19th century gave rise to the field of\nelectronics\n. The later inventions of the\nvacuum tube\nand the\ntransistor\nfurther accelerated the development of electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other engineering specialty.\n[\n6\n]\nChemical engineering\ndeveloped in the late nineteenth century.\n[\n6\n]\nIndustrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by 1880 the need for large scale production of chemicals was such that a new industry was created, dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants.\n[\n6\n]\nThe role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes.\n[\n6\n]\nOriginally deriving from the manufacture of\nceramics\nand its putative derivative metallurgy, materials science is one of the oldest forms of engineering.\n[\n66\n]\nModern materials science evolved directly from\nmetallurgy\n, which itself evolved from the use of fire. Important elements of modern materials science were products of the\nSpace Race\n; the understanding and engineering of the metallic\nalloys\n, and\nsilica\nand\ncarbon\nmaterials, used in building space vehicles enabling the exploration of space. Materials science has driven, and been driven by, the development of revolutionary technologies such as\nrubbers\n,\nplastics\n,\nsemiconductors\n, and\nbiomaterials\n.\nThe\nsolar furnace at Odeillo\nin the\nPyrénées-Orientales\nin\nFrance\ncan reach temperatures up to 3,500 °C (6,330 °F).\nAeronautical engineering deals with\naircraft design process\ndesign while\naerospace engineering\nis a more modern term that expands the reach of the discipline by including\nspacecraft\ndesign. Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the start of the 20th century although the work of\nSir George Cayley\nhas recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century. Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering.\n[\n67\n]\nOnly a\ndecade\nafter the successful flights by the\nWright brothers\n, there was extensive development of aeronautical engineering through development of military aircraft that were used in\nWorld War I\n. Meanwhile, research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining\ntheoretical physics\nwith experiments.\nBranches of engineering\nFor a topical guide, see\nOutline of engineering\n.\nHoover Dam\nis regarded as a major accomplishment in civil engineering\n[\n68\n]\nEngineering is a broad discipline that is often broken down into several sub-disciplines. Although most engineers will usually be trained in a specific discipline, some engineers become multi-disciplined through experience. The traditional disciplines of engineering are civil, mechanical, electrical, and chemical.\n[\n69\n]\n[\n70\n]\n[\n71\n]\n[\n72\n]\n[\n73\n]\n[\n74\n]\n[\n75\n]\n(Sometimes structural,\n[\n69\n]\nindustrial,\n[\n70\n]\nor mining and materials\n[\n70\n]\nis added.)\nBelow is a list of recognized branches of engineering.\n[\n76\n]\n[\n75\n]\nNote that there are additional sub-disciplines.\nType of engineering\nInformation\nAerospace engineering\nAerospace engineering\ncovers the design, development, manufacture and operational behaviour of aircraft, satellites and rockets.\nAgricultural engineering\nAgricultural engineering\nutilizes farm power and machinery, biological material processes, bioenergy, farm structures, and agricultural natural resources.\nBiological engineering\nBiological engineering\nstudies the application of principles of biology and the tools of engineering to create usable, tangible, economically viable products.\nBiomedical engineering\nBiomedical engineering\nis the application of engineering principles and design concepts to medicine and biology for healthcare applications (e.g., diagnostic or therapeutic purposes).\nChemical engineering\nChemical engineering\nis the application of chemical, physical, and biological sciences to developing technological solutions from raw materials or chemicals.\nCivil engineering\nCivil engineering\nis the design and construction of public and private works, such as infrastructure (airports, roads, railways, water supply, and treatment etc.), bridges, tunnels, dams, and buildings.\nComputer engineering\nComputer engineering\nintegrates several fields of computer science and electronic engineering required to develop computer hardware and software.\nElectrical engineering\nElectrical engineering\nfocuses on the design, development, and application of systems and equipment that utilize electricity and electromagnetism.\nEnvironmental engineering\nEnvironmental engineering\nis a specialized field that uses scientific and engineering principles to protect and improve the environment for human health and well-being.\nGeological engineering\nGeological engineering\nis associated with anything constructed on or within the Earth by applying geological sciences and engineering principles to direct or support the work of other disciplines.\nIndustrial engineering\nIndustrial engineering\nfocuses on optimizing complex processes, systems, and organizations by improving efficiency, productivity, and quality.\nMarine engineering\nMarine engineering\ncovers the design, development, manufacture and operational behaviour of watercraft and stationary structures like oil platforms and ports.\nMaterials engineering\nMaterials engineering\nis the application of material science and engineering principles to understand the properties of materials.\nMechanical engineering\nMechanical engineering\ncomprises the design and analysis of heat and mechanical power for the operation of machines and mechanical systems.\nNuclear engineering\nNuclear engineering\nis a multidisciplinary field that deals with the design, construction, operation, and safety of systems that utilize nuclear energy and radiation.\nSoftware engineering\nSoftware engineering\nis a branch of both computer science and engineering focused on designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications. It is distinct from\ncomputer engineering\n.\nInterdisciplinary engineering\nMain article:\nList of engineering branches\nInterdisciplinary engineering draws from more than one of the principle branches of the practice. Historically,\nnaval engineering\nand\nmining engineering\nwere major branches. Other engineering fields are\nmanufacturing engineering\n,\nacoustical engineering\n,\ncorrosion engineering\n,\ninstrumentation and control\n,\nautomotive\n,\ninformation engineering\n,\npetroleum\n,\nsystems\n,\naudio\n,\nsoftware\n,\narchitectural\n,\nbiosystems\n, and\ntextile\nengineering\n.\n[\n77\n]\nThese and other branches of engineering are represented in the 40 licensed member institutions of the UK\nEngineering Council\n, as of 2025\n[update]\n.\n[\n78\n]\nNew specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches – for example,\nEarth systems engineering and management\ninvolves a wide range of subject areas including\nengineering studies\n,\nenvironmental science\n,\nengineering ethics\nand\nphilosophy of engineering\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nPractice\nMain article:\nRegulation and licensure in engineering\nOne who practices engineering is called an\nengineer\n, and those licensed to do so may have more formal designations such as Professional Engineer, Chartered Engineer,\nIncorporated Engineer\n,\nIngenieur\n,\nEuropean Engineer\n. There can also be what is called by the\nFAA\na\nDesignated Engineering Representative\n.\n[\n79\n]\nMethodology\nDesign of a\nturbine\nrequires collaboration of engineers from many fields, as the system involves mechanical, electro-magnetic and chemical processes. The\nblades\n,\nrotor and stator\nas well as the\nsteam cycle\nall need to be carefully designed and optimized.\nIn the\nengineering design\nprocess, engineers apply mathematics and the physical sciences to find novel solutions to problems or to improve existing solutions. Engineers need proficient knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, many engineers continue to learn new material throughout their careers.\n[\n80\n]\nIf multiple solutions exist, engineers weigh each design choice based on their merit and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result. It is generally insufficient to build a technically successful product, rather, it must also meet further requirements.\n[\n80\n]\nConstraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost,\nsafety\n, marketability, productivity, and\nserviceability\n. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive\nspecifications\nfor the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.\n[\n81\n]\nProblem solving\nA drawing for a\nsteam locomotive\n. Engineering is applied to\ndesign\n, with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science.\nEngineers use their knowledge of\nscience\n,\nmathematics\n,\nlogic\n,\neconomics\n, and\nappropriate experience\nor\ntacit knowledge\nto find suitable solutions to a particular problem. Creating an appropriate\nmathematical model\nof a problem often allows them to analyze it (sometimes definitively), and to test potential solutions.\n[\n82\n]\nMore than one solution to a design problem usually exists so the different\ndesign choices\nhave to be evaluated on their merits before the one judged most suitable is chosen.\n[\n83\n]\nGenrich Altshuller\n, after gathering statistics on a large number of\npatents\n, suggested that\ncompromises\nare at the heart of \"\nlow-level\n\" engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem.\n[\n84\n]\nEngineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things:\nprototypes\n,\nscale models\n,\nsimulations\n,\ndestructive tests\n,\nnondestructive tests\n, and\nstress tests\n. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected but only in so far as the testing has been representative of use in service. For products, such as aircraft, that are used differently by different users failures and unexpected shortcomings (and necessary design changes) can be expected throughout the operational life of the product.\n[\n85\n]\nEngineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and, except those employed in specific areas of the\narms industry\n, will not harm people. Engineers typically include a\nfactor of safety\nin their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure. This philosophy is embodied by\nCicero\n's Creed, now considered the original engineer's code of ethics. His slogan,\nsalus populi suprema lex esto\n, translates as \"the health (or safety, or welfare) of the people shall be the supreme law.\"\n[\n86\n]\nThe study of failed products is known as\nforensic engineering\n. It attempts to identify the cause of failure to allow a redesign of the product and so prevent a re-occurrence. Careful analysis is needed to establish the cause of failure of a product. The consequences of a failure may vary in severity from the minor cost of a machine breakdown to large loss of life in the case of accidents involving aircraft and large stationary structures like buildings and dams.\n[\n87\n]\nThese larger scale\nengineering disasters\ncan arise from shortcuts or errors in the design process, such as miscalculations and miscommunication.\n[\n88\n]\nThey can also happen as a result of\nfatigue\nfailure due to\nstress\n, temperature, or\ncorrosion\n.\n[\n89\n]\nFaulty computer software can also play a role.\n[\n90\n]\nComputer use\nSee also:\nComputational engineering\nA computer simulation of high velocity air flow around a\nSpace Shuttle orbiter\nduring re-entry. Solutions to the flow require\nmodelling\nof the combined effects of\nfluid flow\nand the\nheat equations\n.\nAs with all modern scientific and technological endeavors, computers and software play an increasingly important role. As well as the typical business\napplication software\nthere are a number of computer aided applications (\ncomputer-aided technologies\n) specifically for engineering.\n[\n91\n]\nComputers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using\nnumerical methods\n.\n[\n92\n]\nOne of the most widely used\ndesign tools\nin the profession is\ncomputer-aided design\n(CAD) software. It enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with\ndigital mockup\n(DMU) and\nCAE\nsoftware such as\nfinite element method analysis\nor\nanalytic element method\nallows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.\n[\n93\n]\nThese allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics. Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of\nproduct data management\nsoftware.\n[\n94\n]\nThere are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as\ncomputer-aided manufacturing\n(CAM) software to generate\nCNC\nmachining instructions;\n[\n95\n]\nmanufacturing process management\nsoftware for\nproduction engineering\n;\n[\n96\n]\nEDA\nfor\nprinted circuit board\n(PCB)\n[\n97\n]\nand circuit\nschematics\nfor electronic engineers;\nMRO\napplications for maintenance management; and architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) software for civil engineering.\n[\n98\n]\nIn recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as\nproduct lifecycle management\n(PLM).\n[\n99\n]\nSocial context\nRobotic\nKismet\ncan produce a range of facial expressions.\nThe engineering profession engages in a range of activities, from collaboration at the societal level, and smaller individual projects. Almost all engineering projects are obligated to a funding source: a company, a set of investors, or a government. The types of engineering that are less constrained by such a funding source, are\npro bono\n, and\nopen-design\nengineering.\nEngineering has interconnections with society, culture, and human behavior. Most products and constructions used by modern society, are influenced by engineering. Engineering activities have an impact on the environment,\n[\n100\n]\nsociety,\n[\n101\n]\neconomies,\n[\n102\n]\nand public safety.\n[\n103\n]\nEngineering projects can be controversial. Examples from different engineering disciplines include: the development of\nnuclear weapons\n, the\nThree Gorges Dam\n,\n[\n104\n]\nthe design and use of\nsport utility vehicles\n,\n[\n105\n]\nand the extraction of\noil\n. In response, some engineering companies have enacted serious\ncorporate and social responsibility\npolicies.\n[\n106\n]\nThe attainment of many of the\nMillennium Development Goals\nrequires the achievement of sufficient engineering capacity to develop infrastructure and sustainable technological development.\n[\n107\n]\nRadar,\nGPS\n,\nlidar\n, etc. are all combined to provide proper navigation and\nobstacle avoidance\n(vehicle developed for 2007\nDARPA Urban Challenge\n).\nOverseas development and relief NGOs make considerable use of engineers, to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios. Some charitable organizations use engineering directly for development:\nEngineers Without Borders\nEngineers Against Poverty\nRegistered Engineers for Disaster Relief\nEngineers for a Sustainable World\nEngineering for Change\nEngineering Ministries International\n[\n108\n]\nEngineering companies in more developed economies face challenges with regard to the number of engineers being trained, compared with those retiring. This problem is prominent in the UK where engineering has a poor image and low status.\n[\n109\n]\nThere are negative economic and political issues that this can cause, as well as ethical issues.\n[\n110\n]\nIt is agreed the engineering profession faces an \"image crisis\".\n[\n111\n]\nThe UK holds the\nmost engineering companies\ncompared to other European countries, together with the United States.\n[\n112\n]\nCode of ethics\nMain article:\nEngineering ethics\nMany\nengineering societies\nhave established codes of practice and\ncodes of ethics\nto guide members and inform the public at large. The\nNational Society of Professional Engineers\ncode of ethics states:\nEngineering is an important and learned profession. As members of this profession, engineers are expected to exhibit the highest standards of honesty and integrity. Engineering has a direct and vital impact on the quality of life for all people. Accordingly, the services provided by engineers require honesty, impartiality, fairness, and equity, and must be dedicated to the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. Engineers must perform under a standard of professional behavior that requires adherence to the highest principles of ethical conduct.\n[\n113\n]\nIn Canada, engineers wear the\nIron Ring\nas a symbol and reminder of the obligations and ethics associated with their profession.\n[\n114\n]\nRelationships with other disciplines\nScience\nScientists study the world as it is; engineers create the world that has never been.\n—\nTheodore von Kármán\n[\n115\n]\n[\n116\n]\n[\n117\n]\nEngineers, scientists and technicians at work on target positioner inside\nNational Ignition Facility\n(NIF) target chamber\nThere exists an overlap between the sciences and engineering practice; in engineering, one applies science. Both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of materials and phenomena. Both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observations.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nScientists may also have to complete engineering tasks, such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes. Conversely, in the process of developing technology, engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena, thus becoming, for the moment, scientists or more precisely \"engineering scientists\".\n[\n118\n]\nThe\nInternational Space Station\nis used to conduct science experiments in space.\nIn the book\nWhat Engineers Know and How They Know It\n,\n[\n119\n]\nWalter Vincenti\nasserts that engineering research has a character different from that of scientific research. First, it often deals with areas in which the basic\nphysics\nor\nchemistry\nare well understood, but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner.\nThere is a \"real and important\" difference between engineering and physics as similar to any science field has to do with technology.\n[\n120\n]\n[\n121\n]\nPhysics is an exploratory science that seeks knowledge of principles while engineering uses knowledge for practical applications of principles. The former equates an understanding into a mathematical principle while the latter measures variables involved and creates technology.\n[\n122\n]\n[\n123\n]\n[\n124\n]\nFor technology, physics is an auxiliary and in a way technology is considered as applied physics.\n[\n125\n]\nThough physics and engineering are interrelated, it does not mean that a physicist is trained to do an engineer's job. A physicist would typically require additional and relevant training.\n[\n126\n]\nPhysicists and engineers engage in different lines of work.\n[\n127\n]\nBut PhD physicists who specialize in sectors of\nengineering physics\nand\napplied physics\nare titled as Technology officer, R&D Engineers and System Engineers.\n[\n128\n]\nAn example of this is the use of numerical approximations to the\nNavier–Stokes equations\nto describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft, or the use of the\nfinite element method\nto calculate the stresses in complex components. Second, engineering research employs many semi-\nempirical methods\nthat are foreign to pure scientific research, one example being the method of parameter variation.\n[\n129\n]\nAs stated by Fung\net al.\nin the revision to the classic engineering text\nFoundations of Solid Mechanics\n:\nEngineering is quite different from science. Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined. In the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied\nmathematics\n,\nphysics\n,\nchemistry\n,\nbiology\nand\nmechanics\n. Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences were born.\n[\n130\n]\nAlthough engineering solutions make use of scientific principles, engineers must also take into account safety, efficiency, economy, reliability, and constructability or ease of fabrication as well as the environment, ethical and legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution.\n[\n131\n]\nMedicine and biology\nA 3 tesla clinical\nMRI scanner\nThe study of the human body, albeit from different directions and for different purposes, is an important common link between medicine and some engineering disciplines.\nMedicine\naims to sustain, repair, enhance and even replace functions of the\nhuman body\n, if necessary, through the use of\ntechnology\n.\nGenetically engineered mice expressing\ngreen fluorescent protein\n, which glows green under blue light. The central mouse is\nwild-type\n.\nModern medicine can replace several of the body's functions through the use of artificial organs and can significantly alter the function of the human body through artificial devices such as, for example,\nbrain implants\nand\npacemakers\n.\n[\n132\n]\n[\n133\n]\nThe fields of\nbionics\nand medical bionics are dedicated to the study of synthetic implants pertaining to natural systems.\nConversely, some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying and are dedicated to emulating many of its functions by replacing\nbiology\nwith technology. This has led to fields such as\nartificial intelligence\n,\nneural networks\n,\nfuzzy logic\n, and\nrobotics\n. There are also substantial interdisciplinary interactions between engineering and medicine.\n[\n134\n]\n[\n135\n]\nBoth fields provide solutions to real world problems. This often requires moving forward before phenomena are completely understood in a more rigorous scientific sense and therefore experimentation and empirical knowledge is an integral part of both.\nMedicine, in part, studies the function of the human body. The human body, as a biological machine, has many functions that can be modeled using engineering methods.\n[\n136\n]\nThe heart for example functions much like a pump,\n[\n137\n]\nthe skeleton is like a linked structure with levers,\n[\n138\n]\nthe brain produces\nelectrical signals\netc.\n[\n139\n]\nThese similarities as well as the increasing importance and application of engineering principles in medicine, led to the development of the field of\nbiomedical engineering\nthat uses concepts developed in both disciplines.\nNewly emerging branches of science, such as\nsystems biology\n, are adapting analytical tools traditionally used for engineering, such as systems modeling and computational analysis, to the description of biological systems.\n[\n136\n]\nArt\nLeonardo da Vinci\n, seen here in a self-portrait, has been described as the epitome of the artist/engineer.\n[\n140\n]\nHe is also known for his studies on\nhuman anatomy\nand\nphysiology\n.\nThere are connections between engineering and art, for example,\narchitecture\n,\nlandscape architecture\nand\nindustrial design\n(even to the extent that these disciplines may sometimes be included in a university's\nFaculty\nof Engineering).\n[\n141\n]\n[\n142\n]\n[\n143\n]\nThe\nArt Institute of Chicago\n, for instance, held an exhibition about the art of\nNASA\n's aerospace design.\n[\n144\n]\nRobert Maillart\n's bridge design is perceived by some to have been deliberately artistic.\n[\n145\n]\nAt the\nUniversity of South Florida\n, an engineering professor, through a grant with the\nNational Science Foundation\n, has developed a course that connects art and engineering.\n[\n141\n]\n[\n146\n]\nAmong famous historical figures,\nLeonardo da Vinci\nis a well-known\nRenaissance\nartist and engineer, and a prime example of the nexus between art and engineering.\n[\n140\n]\n[\n147\n]\nBusiness\nBusiness engineering\ndeals with the relationship between professional engineering, IT systems, business administration and\nchange management\n.\n[\n148\n]\nEngineering management\nor \"Management engineering\" is a specialized field of\nmanagement\nconcerned with engineering practice or the engineering industry sector.\n[\n149\n]\nThe demand for management-focused engineers (or from the opposite perspective, managers with an understanding of engineering), has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles. During an engineering management course, students will develop\nindustrial engineering\nskills, knowledge, and expertise, alongside knowledge of business administration, management techniques, and strategic thinking. Engineers specializing in change management must have in-depth knowledge of the application of\nindustrial and organizational psychology\nprinciples and methods.\nProfessional engineers often train as\ncertified management consultants\nin the very specialized field of\nmanagement consulting\napplied to engineering practice or the engineering sector. This work often deals with large scale complex\nbusiness transformation\nor\nbusiness process management\ninitiatives in aerospace and defence, automotive, oil and gas, machinery, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, electrical and electronics, power distribution and generation, utilities and transportation systems. This combination of technical engineering practice, management consulting practice, industry sector knowledge, and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives. These initiatives are typically sponsored by C-level executives.\nOther fields\nIn\npolitical science\n, the term\nengineering\nhas been borrowed for the study of the subjects of\nsocial engineering\nand\npolitical engineering\n, which deal with forming\npolitical\nand\nsocial structures\nusing engineering methodology coupled with\npolitical science\nprinciples.\n[\n150\n]\nMarketing engineering\nand\nfinancial engineering\nhave similarly borrowed the term.\n[\n151\n]\n[\n152\n]\nSee also\nEngineering portal\nMain article:\nOutline of engineering\nLists\nList of aerospace engineering topics\nList of basic chemical engineering topics\nList of electrical engineering topics\nList of engineering societies\nList of engineering topics\nList of engineers\nList of genetic engineering topics\nList of mechanical engineering topics\nList of nanoengineering topics\nList of software engineering topics\nGlossaries\nGlossary of areas of mathematics\nGlossary of biology\nGlossary of chemistry\nGlossary of engineering\nGlossary of physics\nRelated subjects\nControversies over the term Engineer\nDesign\nEarthquake engineering\nEngineer\nEngineering disasters\nEngineering economics\nEngineering education\nEngineering education in the United States\nEngineering education research\nEnvironmental engineering science\nGlobal Engineering Education\nGreen engineering\nReverse engineering\nStructural failure\nSustainable engineering\nWomen in engineering\nWikibooks for engineering\nThe following\nWikibooks\nprovide open educational resources related to engineering and software development:\nArtificial Intelligence\nCivil Engineering\nChemical Engineering\nComputer Aided Design\nControl Systems\nEmbedded Systems\nEngineering Acoustics\nEngineering Tables\nEngineering Thermodynamics\nElectrical Engineering\nFluid Mechanics\nMechanical Engineering\nProject Management\nRobotics\nSoftware Engineering\nReferences\n^\nHammack, William; Anderson, John (February 16, 2022).\n\"Working in the Penumbra of Understanding\"\n.\nIssues in Science and Technology\n.\nNational Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine\nand\nArizona State University\n.\nArchived\nfrom the original on August 3, 2023\n.

These tournaments are rigorous academic interscholastic competitions that consist of a series of different hands-on, interactive, challenging and inquiry-based events that are well balanced between the various disciplines of\nbiology\n,\nearth science\n,\nenvironmental science\n,\nchemistry\n,\nphysics\n, engineering and technology. NCSO is housed at The Science House\n[\n4\n]\nat\nNC State University\n.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThe first recorded Science Olympiad was held on Saturday, November 23, 1974, at\nSt. Andrews Presbyterian College\nin\nLaurinburg\n, North Carolina. Dr. Donald Barnes and Dr. David Wetmore were the originators of this event. Fifteen schools from North and South Carolina participated in this event. This Olympiad was a day-long affair, with competitions and demonstrations for high school students in the areas of biology, chemistry, and physics. There were four event periods during this day, and each event period had one fun event (like beaker race or paper airplane), one demonstration (like glassblowing and holography), and one serious event (like periodic table quiz or Science Bowl). An article was published in the\nJournal of Chemical Education\nin January 1978 documenting the success of recruiting students through Science Olympiad.\n[\n5\n]\nSt. Andrews continues to host a Science Olympiad tournament to this day.\n[\n6\n]\nJohn C. \"Jack\" Cairns was a teacher at\nDover High School\nin Delaware in the 1970s when he learned about Science Olympiad taking place in North Carolina. He shared this information with Dr. Douglas R. Macbeth, the Delaware State Science Supervisor. Cairns was appointed to a steering committee to organize the first Olympiad in Delaware which took place at\nDelaware State University\nin the Spring of 1977.\nBy 1982, word about Science Olympiad continued to spread, and caught the attention of Dr. Gerard Putz in\nMacomb County, Michigan\n. Putz invited Cairns to share the success of the Delaware Science Olympiad with Macomb County. As a result, Michigan hosted their first two tournaments in 1983 and 1984\n[\n7\n]\nwhile at the same time Delaware hosted eight similar tournaments.\n[\n8\n]\nPutz and Cairns then decided to share the program with the rest of the nation.\n[\n9\n]\nYear\nDivision B Champions\nDivision B Runner-Up\nDivision C Champions\nDivision C Runner-Up\nHost\n1985\n—\nN/a\n—\nN/a\nPage\n—\nN/a\nNC State University\nRaleigh, North Carolina\n1986\n—\nN/a\n—\nN/a\nNCSSM\nNortheast Guilford\n1987\nDrexel\nWest Rowan\nChapel Hill\nNCSSM\n1988\nDrexel\n—\nN/a\nChapel Hill\nNCSSM\n1989\nDrexel\n—\nN/a\nChapel Hill\n—\nN/a\n1990\nNash Central\n—\nN/a\nPage\nChapel Hill\n1991\nDrexel\nLiberty\nNCSSM\n—\nN/a\n1992\nLiberty\nOur Lady of Lourdes\nNCSSM\nChapel Hill\n1993\nHillcrest\nOur Lady of Lourdes\nNCSSM\nGarner\n1994\nOur Lady of Lourdes\nGreene\nNCSSM\nGarner\n1995\nArendell Parrott\nOur Lady of Lourdes\nChapel Hill\nNCSSM\n1996\nArendell Parrott\nOur Lady of Lourdes\nNCSSM\nChapel Hill\n1997\nArendell Parrott\nMendenhall\nChapel Hill\nJohn T.

Each competitor has individual events that they compete in, instead of\nshot put\nand\njavelin\n, a competitor would participate in Forensics\n[\n10\n]\nand Tower Building.\n[\n11\n]\nCompetitors receive individual rankings in each individual event they compete in, and at the end of the day all the individual event rankings are added together to get the total Team Score. Competitors are able to earn medals in their individual events, and teams can also win an overall trophy for their school.\nScience Olympiad tournaments have four different time periods (and walk-in time periods) when events are held. Due to the number of teams at the state tournament (118 division C teams at the 2015 tournament), the events are instead divided into six time periods of 70 minutes. Most events allow teams of two students to compete (some events allow three).\nRegional Tournament host sites include\nCampbell University\n,\n[\n12\n]\nCatawba Valley Community College\n,\nCumberland County Schools\n,\nEast Carolina University\n,\nFayetteville Technical Community College\n,\nGreen Hope High School\n,\nGuilford County Schools\n,\nLenoir Community College\n,\n[\n13\n]\nLenoir-Rhyne University\n,\nSt. Andrews University\n,\nNew Hanover County Schools\n,\nRaleigh Charter High School\n,\nUNC-Asheville\n,\nUNC-Charlotte\n,\nUNC-Greensboro\n,\n[\n14\n]\nand\nUNC-Wilmington\n.

The events are designed to enhance and strengthen both science content and process skills. Every year NCSO replaces some of the events issued by the National Science Olympiad organization\n[\n20\n]\nwith events that are of local interest to North Carolina.\n[\n21\n]\nThe 18 elementary, 23 middle, and 23 high school events for each competitive year are announced in early Fall. This is followed by a series of workshops as competitors prepare for their events.\n[\n22\n]\n[\n23\n]\nTournaments take place in the Spring, starting with school wide and Regional tournaments, advancing through State and National Tournaments.\n[\n24\n]\n[\n25\n]\nIn the Summer camps are offered across North Carolina.\nThe 64 events of NCSO range from engineering events like Mystery Architecture, Towers and Helicopters to content events such as Microbe Mission, Forensics, and Ecology. The events change each year as new topics are rotated in and old topics rotate out, to ensure every part of curriculum is covered.\nParticipation\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 2011, more than 600 K–12 schools representing over 10,000 students and 65 counties in North Carolina participated in North Carolina Science Olympiad activities.\nTeams may be organized by any charter school, home school group, private or public school. Schools may have as many teams as they wish, the first team from a school is considered the Varsity team and all other teams are Junior Varsity teams. Teams are overseen by a coach.\nDivisions\n[\nedit\n]\nDivision A encompasses grades 3–6, Division B involves grades 6–9, and Division C involves grades 9–12. Teams at all three levels consist of eighteen competitors each in North Carolina.\nThe National tournament team consists of up to fifteen competitors.\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\nIRS 501c3 proof of non profit listing\n.

It was founded in 1855 as the\nAgricultural College of the State of Michigan\n, the first of its kind in the country.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\n[\n10\n]\nAfter the introduction of the\nMorrill Act\nin 1862, the state designated the college a land-grant institution in 1863, making it the first of the\nland-grant colleges\nin the United States. The college became\ncoeducational\nin 1870. Michigan State has facilities across the state, and over 634,000 alumni.\nThe university's six professional schools include the\nCollege of Law\n(founded in\nDetroit\n, in 1891, as the Detroit College of Law and moved to East Lansing in 1995),\nEli Broad College of Business\n; the\nCollege of Nursing\n, the\nCollege of Osteopathic Medicine\n(the world's first state-funded\nosteopathic college\n),\n[\n11\n]\nthe\nCollege of Human Medicine\n, and the\nCollege of Veterinary Medicine\n.

Spartan teams have won national championships in many sports, including football, men's basketball, ice hockey, and women's cross country.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nHistory of Michigan State University\nJohn Clough Holmes\n, co-founder of the Michigan State Agricultural Society and the founder of the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan, now Michigan State University. His legacy is often contrasted with that of\nJohn Harvard\n, whose 17th-century gift established\nHarvard University\n, the nation's oldest college, which was named in his honor.\nTo no one man is the College so much indebted as\nJohn Clough Holmes\n.\n—\nTheophilus C. Abbot\n, third president of the State Agricultural College\n[\n18\n]\nIn early 1855,\nJohn Clough Holmes\n, secretary of the agricultural society, convinced the Michigan legislature to pass an act establishing \"a State Agricultural School\" to be located on a site selected by the Michigan State Agricultural Society within ten miles of Lansing. On February 12, 1855,\nMichigan Governor\nKinsley S. Bingham\nsigned a bill establishing the nation's first agriculture college, the\nAgricultural College of the State of Michigan\n.\n[\n19\n]\n[\n20\n]\nWilliam J. Beal\ncalled Holmes \"the most important agent\" of the college.\n[\n18\n]\nHolmes Hall, the home of the\nLyman Briggs College\n, is named in his honor.\nThe State Board of Education was designated as the institution's governing body. The board also oversaw the\nMichigan State Normal School\nin\nYpsilanti\n, which had opened in 1852.\n[\n21\n]\nClasses began on May 13, 1857, with three buildings, five faculty members, and 63 male students.\nJoseph R. Williams\n, the first president and a passionate promoter of\ninterdisciplinary\nliberal arts education\n, encouraged a curriculum that went far beyond practical agriculture: \"The course of instruction in said college shall include the following branches of education, viz: an English and scientific course, natural philosophy, chemistry, botany, animal and vegetable anatomy and physiology, geology, mineralogy, meteorology, entomology, veterinary art, mensuration, leveling and political economy, with bookkeeping and the mechanic arts which are directly connected with agriculture...\" From its inception, the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan offered courses of study that would characterize the land-grant philosophy of higher education after the passage of the Morrill Act in 1862. Michigan's agricultural college educated people to be well-informed citizens, as well as good farmers.\n[\n22\n]\nHowever, after just two years, Williams ran into conflict with the managing State Board of Education. Despite Williams' eloquent defense of an all-round education for the masses, the board saw the college as inefficient and had far deviated from the agriculture focus as the founder,\nJohn Clough Holmes\n, had anticipated. Indeed, some agriculturalists began protesting against the college's unpractical curriculum with some even calling for the college's abolition.\n[\n23\n]\nWilliams eventually resigned in 1859. The board then reduced the curriculum to a two-year, vocation-oriented farming program, which proved catastrophic and resulted almost overnight in a drastic reduction in enrollment.\n[\n24\n]\n[\n25\n]\nThere was a high demand for an all-round education grounded in the\nliberal arts\ntradition instead of a specialized agriculture program, a fact the board disregarded. With a sharp decrease in tuition revenue, the college was soon in dire financial straits and threatened with dissolution.\nIn 1860, Williams became acting\nlieutenant governor\n[\n26\n]\nand helped pass the Reorganization Act of 1861. This restored the college's four-year curriculum and gave the college the power to grant master's degrees. Under the act, a newly created body, known as the State Board of Agriculture, took over from the State Board of Education in running the institution.\n[\n20\n]\nThe college changed its name to\nState Agricultural College\n, and its first class graduated in the same year.\nLiberty Hyde Bailey\n, namesake of\nBailey Hall\nat\nCornell\n, often called the \"Father of American Horticulture,\" graduated from the Agricultural College in 1882.\nIn 1862, President\nAbraham Lincoln\nsigned the\nMorrill Land-Grant Acts\nto support similar colleges nationally, the first instance of federal funding for education.\n[\n27\n]\nShortly thereafter, on March 18, 1863, the state designated the college its land-grant institution making Michigan State University the nation's first land-grant college.\n[\n28\n]\nThe federal funding had rescued the Agricultural College from extinction.\nAlthough the school's then-isolated location limited student housing and enrollment during the 19th century, the college became reputable, largely due to alumni who went on to distinguished careers, many of whom led or taught in other land-grant colleges. While the institution emphasized scientific agriculture, its graduates went into a wide variety of professions.\nThe college first admitted women in 1870, although there were no female residence halls. The few women who enrolled boarded with faculty families or made the arduous\nstagecoach\ntrek from Lansing. From the early days, female students took the same rigorous scientific agriculture courses as male students. In 1896, the faculty created a \"Women Course\" that melded a\nhome economics\ncurriculum with\nliberal arts\nand sciences. That same year, the college turned the Abbot Hall male dorm into a women's dormitory.\nIt was not until 1899 that the State Agricultural College admitted its first African American student, William O. Thompson. After graduation, he taught at what is now\nTuskegee University\n. A few years later,\nMyrtle Craig\nbecame the first woman African American student to enroll at the college.\n[\n29\n]\nTwo years later, the college changed its name to\nMichigan Agricultural College\n.\nDuring the early 20th century, Michigan Agricultural College expanded its curriculum well beyond agriculture. By 1925, it had expanded enough to change its name to\nMichigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science\n(MSC), or \"Michigan State\" for short. In 1941, the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture,\nJohn A. Hannah\n, became president of the college.\nMorrill Hall in 1912, known at the time as the \"Women's Building\".\n[\n30\n]\nTo the right are Horticulture, Bacteriology, Botany, and Administration (Library–Museum).\nMichigan Agricultural College's Laboratory Row in 1912: Horticulture, Bacteriology, Botany, Dairy, Entomology, and Agriculture\n[\n31\n]\n[\n32\n]\nAfter World War II, Hannah began the largest expansion in the institution's history, with the help of the 1945\nG.I. Bill\n, which helped World War II veterans gain college educations. One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction of another dormitory. Under his plan, enrollment increased from 15,000 in 1950 to 38,000 in 1965.\n[\n33\n]\n[\n34\n]\nSix years later, during the school's centennial year of 1955, the State of Michigan officially designated the school as a university, even though Hannah and others felt it had been one for decades. The college then became\nMichigan State University of Agriculture and Applied Science\n.\n[\n35\n]\nDuring the 1950s, Michigan State University was the \"preeminent\" example of a group of former agricultural colleges which had already evolved into state colleges and were attempting to become research universities.\n[\n36\n]\nIn 1957, Hannah continued MSU's expansion by co-founding Michigan State University–Oakland, now\nOakland University\n, with\nMatilda Dodge Wilson\n.\nAfter the ratification of the Michigan Constitution of 1964, the university's governing body changed its name from the State Board of Agriculture to the Michigan State University Board of Trustees.\n[\n37\n]\nMSU was affiliated with\nOakland University\nin Rochester Hills, Michigan, from the time of the latter's founding in 1957 (as Michigan State University-Oakland), until 1970 when Oakland University gained institutional independence.\nIn September 2005, President\nLou Anna Simon\ncalled for Michigan State to become the global model leader for land-grant institutions by 2012. Her plans included creating a new\nresidential college\nand increased grants awarded from the\nNational Institutes of Health\npast the US$100\nmillion mark. While there are over 100\nland-grant universities\nin the United States, she stated she would like Michigan State University to be the leader.\n[\n38\n]\nCampus\n[\nedit\n]\nBeaumont Tower\nmarks the site of\nCollege Hall\n.\nMSU's sprawling campus is in\nEast Lansing, Michigan\n. The campus is perched on the banks of the\nRed Cedar River\n. Development of the campus started in 1856 with three buildings: a multipurpose\nCollege Hall\nbuilding, a dormitory later called \"\nSaints' Rest\n\",\n[\n39\n]\nand a barn. Today, MSU's contiguous campus consists of 5,300 acres (2,100 ha),\n[\n5\n]\n2,000 acres (810 ha) of which are developed. There are 563\n[\n5\n]\nbuildings: 107\n[\n5\n]\nfor academics, 131 for agriculture, 166 for housing and\nfood service\n, and 42 for athletics. Overall, the university has 22,763,025 square feet (2,114,754.2 m\n2\n) of indoor space.\n[\n40\n]\nConnecting it all is 26 miles (42 km) of roads and 100 miles (160 km) of sidewalks.\n[\n41\n]\nMSU also owns 44 non-campus properties, totaling 22,000 acres (8,900 ha) in 28 different counties.\n[\n42\n]\nThe water fountain, with the Plant Biology building in the background\nWells Hall\nIn early 2017, construction of a $22.5\nmillion solar project began at five parking lots on campus. MSU's solar carport array is constructed on five of the university's largest commuter parking lots and covers 5,000\n[\n43\n]\nparking spaces. The solar carports are designed to deliver a peak power of 10.5 Megawatts and an annual energy of 15 million kilowatt-hours, which is enough to power approximately 1,800 Michigan homes.\n[\n44\n]\nThe solar carport project was recognized at the Smart Energy Decisions Innovation Summit 2018, earning the Onsite Renewable Energy award for “The Largest Carport Solar Array in North America.”\n[\n45\n]\nSome land owned by MSU is in\nLansing\n,\n[\n46\n]\nLansing Charter Township\n,\n[\n47\n]\nAlaiedon Township\n,\n[\n48\n]\nDelhi Charter Township\n,\n[\n49\n]\nand\nMeridian Charter Township\n.\n[\n50\n]\nNorth campus\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nCampus of Michigan State University\nW. J. Beal Botanical Garden\nThe oldest part of campus lies on the Red Cedar river's north bank.\n[\n51\n]\nIt includes\nCollegiate Gothic\narchitecture, plentiful trees, and curving roads with few straight lines. The college built its first three buildings here, of which none survive. Other historic buildings north of the river include the president's official residence,\nCowles House\n; and\nBeaumont Tower\n, a\ncarillon\nclock tower marking the site of\nCollege Hall\n, the original classroom building. To the east lies\nEustace–Cole Hall\n, America's first freestanding horticulture laboratory.\n[\n52\n]\nOther landmarks include the bronze statue of former president\nJohn A. Hannah\n,\n[\n53\n]\nthe\nW. J. Beal Botanical Garden\n, and the painted boulder known as \"\nThe Rock\n\", a popular spot for theater,\ntailgating\n, and candlelight vigils. On the campus's northwest corner is the university's hotel, the Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center. The university also has two museums.\nMSU Museum\n, initiated in 1857, is one of the Midwest's oldest museums and is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums.\n[\n54\n]\nThe\nEli and Edythe Broad Art Museum\n, designed by\nZaha Hadid\n, opened in 2012 as MSU's primary art gallery, and features art from MSU's permanent collection as well as from graduate students on campus.\n[\n55\n]\nSouth campus\n[\nedit\n]\nHidden Lake Gardens Visitor Center\nThe campus south of the river consists mostly of post-World War II\nInternational Style\nbuildings, and is characterized by sparser foliage, relatively straight roadways, and many parking lots. The \"2020 Vision\" Master Plan proposes replacing these parking lots with\nparking ramps\nand green space,\n[\n56\n]\nbut these plans will take many years to reach fruition. As part of the master plan, the university erected a new bronze statue of\nThe Spartan\nin 2005 to be placed at the intersection of Chestnut and Kalamazoo, just south of the Red Cedar River. This replica replaced the original\nmodernist\nterra cotta\nstatue,\n[\n57\n]\nwhich can still be seen inside\nSpartan Stadium\n. Notable academic and research buildings on the South Campus include the\nCyclotron\n, the\nCollege of Law\n, the\nFacility for Rare Isotope Beams\n(FRIB), Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Building,\n[\n58\n]\nand the Broad College of Business.\n[\n59\n]\nThis part of campus is home to the\nMSU Horticulture Gardens\nand the adjoining\n4-H\nChildren's Garden. South of the gardens lie the\nCanadian National\nand\nCSX\nrailroads, which divide the main campus from thousands of acres of university-owned farmland. The university's agricultural facilities include the Horse, Dairy Cattle, Beef Cattle, Swine, Sheep, and Poultry Teaching and Research Farms, as well as the Air Quality Control Lab and the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.\n[\n60\n]\nKellogg Hotel and Conference Center\n[\nedit\n]\nKellogg House on\nGull Lake\n.\nWilliam Keith Kellogg\ndonated his summer home to Michigan State University. It is used as a conference center for MSU's Biological and Agricultural Research.\nThe Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center doubles as a 4-star hotel and a business-friendly conference center. It is on the northwest corner of Michigan State University's campus, across from the\nBrody Complex\n, on Harrison Road just south of Michigan Avenue. The hotel's 160 rooms and suites can accommodate anyone staying in East Lansing for a business conference, sporting event or an on-campus visit. Besides a lodging facility, the Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center is a \"learning laboratory for the 300–400 students each year that are enrolled in The School of Hospitality Business and other majors.\" The Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center strives to facilitate education by hosting conferences and seminars.\n[\n61\n]\nDubai campus\n[\nedit\n]\nMSU ran a small campus at\nDubai Knowledge Village\n, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\n[\n62\n]\nIt first offered only one program, a master's program in human resources and labor relations. In 2011, it added a master's program in Public Health.\n[\n63\n]\nPreviously, MSU established an education center in Dubai that offered six undergraduate programs, thereby becoming the first American university with a presence in\nDubai International Academic City\n. The university attracted 100 students in 2007, its first year,\n[\n64\n]\nbut the school was unable to achieve the 100–150 new students per year needed for the program to be viable, and in 2010 MSU closed the program and the campus.\n[\n63\n]\n[\n65\n]\n[\n66\n]\nDetroit campus\n[\nedit\n]\nMSU has a large presence in downtown\nDetroit\n.

In the 1960s, MSU scientists developed\ncisplatin\n, a leading cancer fighting drug, and followed that work with the derivative,\ncarboplatin\n.\nAlbert Fert\n, an\nadjunct professor\nat MSU, was awarded the 2007\nNobel Prize in Physics\ntogether with\nPeter Grünberg\n.\n[\n111\n]\nMichigan State continues its research with facilities such as the\nU.S. Department of Energy\n-sponsored MSU-DOE Plant Research Laboratory\n[\n112\n]\nand a\nparticle accelerator\ncalled the\nNational Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory\n. The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science named Michigan State University as the site for the\nFacility for Rare Isotope Beams\n(FRIB) facility. Construction began in 2014 and was completed in 2022.\n[\n113\n]\nThe $730\nmillion facility has a goal to attract top researchers from around the world to conduct experiments in basic nuclear science, astrophysics, and applications of isotopes to other fields.\n[\n5\n]\nIn 2004, scientists at the cyclotron produced and observed a new isotope of the element\ngermanium\n, called Ge-60.\n[\n114\n]\nIn that same year, Michigan State, in consortium with the\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\nand the government of\nBrazil\n, broke ground on the 4.1-meter\nSouthern Astrophysical Research Telescope\n(SOAR) in the\nAndes Mountains\nof\nChile\n. The consortium telescope will allow the Physics & Astronomy department to study galaxy formation and origins.\n[\n115\n]\nSince 1999, MSU has been part of a consortium called the\nMichigan Life Sciences Corridor\n, which aims to develop\nbiotechnology\nresearch in the State of Michigan.\n[\n116\n]\nFinally, the College of Communication Arts and Sciences'\nQuello Center\nresearches issues of information and communication management.\nMichigan State, the\nUniversity of Michigan\n, and\nWayne State University\ncreated the\nUniversity Research Corridor\nin 2006.\n[\n117\n]\nThis alliance was formed to transform and strengthen Michigan's economy by reaching out to businesses, policymakers, innovators, investors and the public to speed up technology transfer, make resources more accessible and attract new jobs to the state.\n[\n117\n]\nEndowment\n[\nedit\n]\nMSU's (private, non-\nMorrill Act\n)\nendowment\nstarted in 1916, when the Engineering Building burned down.

Olds\nhelped the program stay afloat with a gift of $100,000, equivalent to $2.96\nmillion in 2025.\n[\n118\n]\nThere was a time when MSU lagged behind peer institutions in terms of endowments. As recently as the early 1990s, MSU was last among the eleven Big Ten schools (of the time), with barely over $100\nmillion in endowment funds.\n[\n119\n]\nThis changed dramatically in the 2000s decade, when the university started a campaign to increase the size of the endowment.\nAt the close of\nfiscal year\n2004–2005, the endowment had risen to $1.325\nbillion, raising the university to sixth of the 11 Big Ten schools in terms of endowment; within $2\nmillion of the fifth-rated school.\n[\n120\n]\nAs of June 30, 2021, MSU's endowment had a market value of $4.4\nbillion.\n[\n121\n]\nColleges\n[\nedit\n]\nMSU has over 200 academic programs offered by 17 degree-granting colleges.\n[\n5\n]\nResidential colleges\n[\nedit\n]\nLinton Hall\nMSU's first residential college,\nJustin Morrill\nCollege started in 1965 with an interdisciplinary curriculum.\n[\n122\n]\nMSU closed Morrill College in 1979, but today the university has three residential colleges, including the recent opening of the\nResidential College in Arts & Humanities\n(RCAH) located in Snyder and Phillips halls.\nEstablished in 1967,\nJames Madison College\nis a smaller component residential college featuring multidisciplinary programs in the social sciences, founded on a model of liberal education. James Madison College is housed in Case Hall. Classes in the college are small, with an average of 25 students, and most instructors are\ntenure\ntrack faculty. James Madison College has about 1150 students total, with each\nfreshman\nclass containing about 320 students.\n[\n123\n]\nEach of Madison's four\nmajors\n—Social Relations and Policy, International Relations, Political Theory and Constitutional Democracy, and Comparative Cultures and Politics\n[\n124\n]\n—requires two years of foreign language and one semester of \"field experience\" in an\ninternship\nor study abroad program. Although Madison students make up about 4% of MSU graduates, they represent around 35% of the MSU's\nPhi Beta Kappa\nmembers.\n[\n125\n]\nMorrill Hall\nOlds Hall\nSnyder-Phillips Hall was built in 1947. The building was expanded to make room for a new residential college.\nBerkey Hall\nEustace-Cole Hall\nwas the United States' first freestanding horticulture laboratory. It is the only MSU building on the\nNational Register of Historic Places\n. Additionally, Eustace-Cole Hall houses the offices of the Michigan State University Honors College.\nAlso established in 1967,\nLyman Briggs College\nteaches math and science within social, historical and philosophical contexts.\n[\n126\n]\nMany Lyman Briggs students intend to pursue careers in medicine, but the school supports over 30 coordinate majors, from human biology to computer sciences.\n[\n127\n]\nLyman Briggs is one of the few colleges that lets undergraduates teach as \"Learning Assistants.\"\n[\n128\n]\nMSU's newest residential college is the\nResidential College in the Arts and Humanities (RCAH)\n. Founded October 21, 2005,\n[\n129\n]\nRCAH provides around 600\nundergraduates\nwith an individualized curriculum in the\nliberal\n,\nvisual\nand\nperforming arts\n. Though all the students will graduate with the same\ndegree\n, MSU encourages students in the college to get a\nsecond degree\nor specialization.\n[\n130\n]\nThe university houses the new college in a newly renovated Snyder-Phillips Hall, the location of MSU's first residential college, Justin Morrill College.\n[\n131\n]\nProfessional schools\n[\nedit\n]\nHuman Ecology Building\nFounded in Detroit in 1891 as the Detroit College of Law, the law school moved to East Lansing in 1995, becoming\nMichigan State University College of Law\n.

The law school publishes the\nMichigan State Law Review\n,\n[\n132\n]\nthe Michigan State Journal of International Law, the Journal of Medicine Law, and the Journal of Business & Securities Law. The College of Law is the home of the\nGeoffrey Fieger\nTrial Practice Institute,\n[\n133\n]\nthe first trial practice institute in the United States. In October 2018, MSU's board of trustees voted to fully integrate the College of Law into the university, thereby converting it from a private to a public law school.

The dean of the college, Randolph Rasch, was appointed to a statewide task force in 2020 by the governor to help establish an implicit bias training initiative for all health care workers in the state.\n[\n140\n]\nThe\nMichigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine\nwas the world's first publicly funded college of\nosteopathic medicine\n.\n[\n141\n]\nIt has a long-standing tradition of retaining its alumni in Michigan to practice – more than two-thirds of the college's graduates remain to practice in Michigan.\n[\n142\n]\nIn 2008, the Michigan State University Board of Trustees approved a resolution endorsing the expansion of the College of Osteopathic Medicine to two sites in\nsoutheast Michigan\n, a move board members and college officials say will not only improve medical education in the state, but also address a projected physician\nshortage\n.\n[\n143\n]\nAccording to\nU.S. News & World Report\n's\n2016 rankings, the College of Osteopathic Medicine (\nD.O. degree\n) ranked tied for 12th among U.S. medical schools for primary care,\n[\n144\n]\nand the College of Human Medicine (MD degree) was ranked 70th among the U.S. medical schools for primary care.\n[\n145\n]\nThe\nCollege of Human Medicine\ngraduates students with a\nDoctor of Medicine\n(M.D. degree) and is split into seven distinct campuses located in\nEast Lansing\n,\nKalamazoo\n,\nFlint\n,\nSaginaw\n,\nMarquette\n,\nTraverse City\nand\nGrand Rapids\n. Each campus is affiliated with local hospitals and other medical facilities professionals in the area.\n[\n146\n]\nFor example, the Lansing campus includes\nSparrow Hospital\nand\nMcLaren–Greater Lansing Hospital\n.\n[\n147\n]\nThe College of Human Medicine has recently gained attention for its expansion into the Grand Rapids area, with the new Secchia Center completed in the Fall of 2010, that is expected to fuel the growing medical industry in that region.\n[\n148\n]\nThough Michigan State has offered courses in veterinary science since its founding, the\nCollege of Veterinary Medicine\nwas not formally established as a four-year, degree-granting program until 1910.\n[\n149\n]\nIn 2011, the Michigan State University College of Veterinary Medicine was ranked No. 9 in the nation.\n[\n150\n]\nThe college has over 170,000 square feet (16,000 m\n2\n) of office, teaching, and research space, as well as a veterinary\nteaching hospital\n.\n[\n151\n]\nOther academic units\n[\nedit\n]\nIn recent years, MSU's music program has grown substantially. Music major enrollment increased more than 97% between 1991 and 2004.\n[\n152\n]\nIn early 2007, this growth led the university board of trustees to spin the music program off into its own college unit: The MSU College of Music.\n[\n153\n]\nThe new college faces many new challenges, such as working with limited space\n[\n154\n]\nand funding.\n[\n155\n]\nNevertheless, MSU's music college plans on continued success, placing an annual average of 25 graduate students in tenure stream university positions.\n[\n152\n]\nThe\nCollege of Education at Michigan State University\noffers graduate and undergraduate degrees in several fields, including\ncounseling\n,\neducational psychology\n,\nspecial education\n,\nteacher education\nand\nkinesiology\n.\n[\n156\n]\nThe graduate school has several programs ranked in the top five in the country by\nU.S. News & World Report\nfor 2016: elementary teacher education (1st), secondary teacher education (1st), curriculum and instruction (3rd), educational psychology (4th), and higher education administration (4th).\n[\n101\n]\nThe College of Education is housed in Erickson Hall. MSU offers a 30 credit graduate program for a Master of Arts in Educational Technology\n[\n157\n]\nin 3 different formats; completely online,\n[\n158\n]\nhybrid\n[\n159\n]\nin East Lansing, or overseas. Founded in 1956, the\nMSU Honors College\nprovides individualized curricula to MSU's top undergraduate students. Though the college offers no majors of its own, it has its own\ndean\nand academic advisers to help Honors students with their educational pursuits.\nHigh school students starting at MSU may join the Honors College if they are in the top 5% of their high school graduating class and have an\nACT\nscore of at least 30 or an\nSAT\ntotal score of at least 1360.\n[\n160\n]\nStudents can also be admitted after their first semester, generally if they're in the top 10% of their College in GPA. Once admitted, students must maintain a 3.20 GPA and complete eight approved honors courses to graduate with Honors College designation on their degree. If membership is relinquished, it cannot be reclaimed.\n[\n161\n]\nAfter three years of planning,\nThe College of Engineering\nlaunched the first stages of its Residential Experience for Spartan Engineering, formally known as the Residential Option for Scientists and Engineers (ROSES). The program was in Wilson Hall after being housed in Bailey Hall for a number of years. The Residential program essentially combines with a brand new academic component, Cornerstone Engineering, where freshman engineering students not only get an overview of the engineering field, but also get a hands-on experience along with it.\n[\n162\n]\nGlobal Engineering\nis a new subject that is of interest for not only the Cornerstone Engineering and Residential Experience programs, but the entire\nCollege of Engineering\nat MSU. Engineering in today's society has shown to have a monumental impact on the global economy due to advancements in education, as well as interdependence on economics with infrastructure, computers, transportation, technology and other\nmanufactured goods\n. The newly established Cornerstone Engineering and Residential Experience (CoRe) program\n[\n163\n]\nin the\nCollege of Engineering\nhas started programs abroad for more courses in engineering, including\nstudy abroad\nseminars\n.\n[\n164\n]\nIn 2014, the\nDetroit Free Press\nwrote a news article referencing Michigan State University's Recruiting Trends 2014–15 report, which ranked engineering among the top 20 college degrees with the highest starting salaries.\n[\n165\n]\nMSU's original mission as an agricultural college continues today in the\nCollege of Agriculture & Natural Resources\n.\n[\n166\n]\nAthletics\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nMichigan State Spartans\nand\nList of Michigan State Spartans championships\nMichigan State's\nNCAA Division I-A\nprogram offers 12\nvarsity\nsports for men and 13 for women.\n[\n5\n]\nSince their teams are called the Spartans, MSU's mascot is a Spartan warrior named\nSparty\n.

Each residence hall has its own hall government, with representatives in the\nResidence Halls Association\n. Yet despite the size and extent of on-campus housing, the residence halls are complemented by a variety of housing options. 58% of students live off-campus,\n[\n179\n]\nmostly in the areas closest to campus, in either apartment buildings, former single-family homes, fraternity and sorority houses, or in a\nco-op\n.\nIn 2014 there were approximately 50,085 students, 38,786 undergraduate and 11,299 graduate and professional.

Twelve of the Afghan evacuees attached to this program were students in the university's Grain Research and Innovation (GRAIN) project, hosted by\nKabul University\n. Bypassing typical financial review procedures, university officials paid $250,000 on a university credit card for the emergency charter of an airplane to reunite evacuees in\nAlbania\n. MSU facilitated the students' transfer to the\nAgricultural University of Tirana\nand then assisted in humanitarian parole into the United States in early 2022.\n[\n190\n]\n[\n191\n]\nIn February 2023, the Chinese Consulate-General in Chicago announced that two Chinese MSU students had been wounded in the\n2023 Michigan State University shooting\n.\n[\n192\n]\n[\n193\n]\nBased on 2021 enrollment data from the university's international office, China was still likely the largest source of international students for MSU at the time of the shooting.\n[\n194\n]\nFraternities and sororities\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nList of Michigan State University fraternities and sororities\nWith over 3,000 members, Michigan State University's\nGreek Community\nis one of the largest in the US.\n[\n195\n]\nStarted in 1872 and re-established in 1922 by\nLambda Chi Alpha\nfraternity,\nAlpha Gamma Rho\nfraternity, and\nAlpha Phi\nsorority; the MSU Greek system now consists of 55 Greek lettered student societies.\n[\n196\n]\nThese chapters are in turn under the jurisdiction of one of MSU's four Greek governing councils:\nNational Panhellenic Conference\n, North American Interfraternity Council,\nNational Pan-Hellenic Council\n,\n[\n197\n]\nand Independent Greek Council. National Pan-Hellenic Council is made up of nine organizations, five fraternities and four sororities.\n[\n198\n]\nThe\nInterfraternity Council\nand the\nWomen's Panhellenic Council\nare each entirely responsible for their own budgets, giving them the freedom to hold large fundraising and recruitment events. MSU's fraternities and sororities hold many philanthropy events and community fundraisers. For example, in April 2011 the Greek Community held Greek Week to raise over $260,000 for the\nAmerican Cancer Society\n, and $5,000 for each of these charities:\nBig Brothers Big Sisters\n,\nThe Listening Ear\nand previous charities include: the\nMake-a-Wish Foundation\n(MSU Chapter), Share Laura's Hope, The Mary Beth Knox Scholarship, and the\nSpecial Olympics\n, in which fraternity and sorority members get to help each other participate.\n[\n199\n]\nStudent organizations\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Student Services Building houses the MSU Department of Student Life, as well as ASMSU and the Greek governing councils.\nThe Associated Students of Michigan State University (ASMSU) is the all-university undergraduate\nstudent government\nof Michigan State University.\n[\n200\n]\nIt was unusual among university\nstudent governments\nfor its\ndecentralized\nbicameral structure,\n[\n201\n]\nand the relatively non-existent influence of the Greek system. The structure has since changed to a single General Assembly as part of reorganization in the late 2000s. ASMSU representatives are\nnonpartisan\nand many are elected in noncompetitive races. Some services they offer include free blue books, low-cost copies and printing, free yearbooks, interest free loans, funding for student organizations, free legal consultation, and iClicker and graphing calculator rentals.\nStudents pay $21 per semester to fund the functions of the ASMSU, including stipends for the organization's officers and activities throughout the year.\n[\n202\n]\nSome students have criticized ASMSU for not having enough electoral participation to gain a student mandate.\nTurnout\nsince 2001 has hovered between 3 and 17 percent, with the 2006 election bringing out 8% of the undergraduate student body.\n[\n203\n]\nStudent-run organizations beyond student government also have a large impact on the East Lansing/Michigan State University community. Student Organizations are registered through the Department of Student Life, which currently has a registry of over 800 student organizations.\n[\n204\n]\nThe Eli Broad College of Business includes 27 student organizations of primary interest to business students. The three largest organizations are the Finance Association (FA), the Accounting Student Association (ASA), and the Supply Chain Management Association (SCMA).\n[\n205\n]\nThe SCMA is the host of the university's largest major specific career fair. The fair attracts over 100 companies and over 400 students each year.\n[\n206\n]\nActivism\n[\nedit\n]\nActivists\nhave played a significant role in MSU history. During the height of the\nVietnam War\n, student protests helped create\nco-ed\nresidence halls, and blocked the routing of\nInterstate 496\nthrough campus.\n[\n207\n]\nIn the 1980s, Michigan State students convinced the university to\ndivest\nthe stocks of companies doing business in\napartheid\nSouth Africa from its endowment portfolio, such as\nCoca-Cola\n.\n[\n208\n]\nIn 2011, a student group staged a large sit-in protest in the university President's office as the culmination of multiple years of attempting to convince the administration to transition from coal energy production to 100% clean energy.\n[\n209\n]\nIn 2019, Michigan Governor\nGretchen Whitmer\njoined the Lansing Women's March, standing with victims of sexual assault on campus.\n[\n210\n]\nFollowing the\nFebruary 13th shooting\non campus which killed three students, a student group organized a peaceful protest on the steps of the\nMichigan State Capitol\n.\n[\n211\n]\nThis protest quickly led to new gun control bills being passed within the Michigan state legislature.\n[\n212\n]\nMSU has many student groups focused on political change. Graduate campus groups include the Graduate Employees Union\n[\n213\n]\nand the Council of Graduate Students.\n[\n214\n]\nSustainability\n[\nedit\n]\nMSU's campus is heavily forested.

For other uses, see\nStem (disambiguation)\n.\nPhysicist\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer\n(left) and mathematician\nJohn von Neumann\nin front of an\nearly electronic computer\nbuilt at the\nInstitute for Advanced Study\n, Princeton, New Jersey, United States (1952)\nScience, technology, engineering, and mathematics\n(\nSTEM\n) is an\numbrella term\nused to group together the related technical disciplines of\nscience\n,\ntechnology\n,\nengineering\n, and\nmathematics\n. It represents a broad and interconnected set of fields that are crucial for innovation and technological advancement. These disciplines are often grouped together because they share a common emphasis on\ncritical thinking\n,\nproblem-solving\n, and\nanalytical skills\n.\n[\n1\n]\nThe term is typically used in the context of\neducation policy\nor\ncurriculum\nchoices in schools. It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns (as a shortage of STEM-educated citizens can reduce effectiveness in this area), and immigration policy, with regard to admitting foreign students and tech workers.\n[\n2\n]\nThere is no universal agreement on which disciplines are included in STEM; in particular, whether or not the\nscience\nin STEM includes\nsocial sciences\n, such as\npsychology\n,\nsociology\n,\neconomics\n, and\npolitical science\n. In the United States, these are typically included by the\nNational Science Foundation\n(NSF),\n[\n2\n]\nthe\nDepartment of Labor\n's\nO*Net\nonline database for job seekers,\n[\n3\n]\nand the\nDepartment of Homeland Security\n.\n[\n4\n]\nIn the United Kingdom, the social sciences are categorized separately and are instead grouped with\nhumanities\nand\narts\nto form another counterpart acronym\nHASS\n(humanities, arts, and social sciences),\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nrebranded in 2020 as\nSHAPE\n(social sciences, humanities and the arts for people and the economy).\n[\n5\n]\n[\n6\n]\nSome sources also use HEAL (health, education, administration, and literacy) as the counterpart of STEM.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nTerminology\n[\nedit\n]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nIn the early 1990s the acronym STEM was used by a variety of educators. Beverly P. Schwartz developed a STEM mentoring program in the Capital District of New York State, and was using the acronym as early as November, 1991.\n[\n7\n]\nJane Silverstein, Founder of the STEM Academy at\nJohn F. Kennedy High School (Patterson, New Jersey)\nused the term “STEM” in the mid-1990s and claims to have created the first “STEM” curriculum.\n[\n8\n]\nCharles E. Vela was the founder and director of the Center for the Advancement of Hispanics in Science and Engineering Education (CAHSEE)\n[\n9\n]\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\nand started a summer program for talented under-represented students in the Washington, D.C. area called the STEM Institute. Based on the program's recognized success and his expertise in STEM education,\n[\n12\n]\nCharles Vela was asked to serve on numerous NSF and Congressional panels in science, mathematics, and engineering education.\n[\n13\n]\nPreviously referred to as SMET by the NSF,\n[\n14\n]\nit is through this manner that NSF was first introduced to the acronym STEM. One of the first NSF projects to use the acronym was STEMTEC, the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math Teacher Education Collaborative at the\nUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst\n, which was founded in 1998.\n[\n15\n]\nIn 2001, at the urging of Dr. Peter Faletra, the Director of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists at the Office of Science, the acronym was adopted by\nRita Colwell\nand other science administrators in the\nNational Science Foundation\n(NSF). The Office of Science was also an early adopter of the STEM acronym.\n[\n16\n]\nOther variations\n[\nedit\n]\neSTEM (environmental STEM)\n[\n17\n]\n[\n18\n]\nGEMS (girls in engineering, math, and science); used for programs to encourage women to enter these fields.\n[\n19\n]\n[\n20\n]\nMINT (mathematics, informatics, natural sciences, and technology)\n[\n21\n]\nSHTEAM (science, humanities, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics)\n[\n22\n]\nSMET (science, mathematics, engineering, and technology); previous name\n[\n14\n]\nSTEAM\n(science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics)\n[\n23\n]\nSTEAM (science, technology, engineering, agriculture, and mathematics); add agriculture\n[\n24\n]\nSTEAM (science, technology, engineering, and\napplied mathematics\n); has more focus on applied mathematics\n[\n25\n]\nSTEEM (science, technology, engineering, economics, and mathematics); adds economics as a field\n[\n26\n]\nSTEMIE (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, invention, and entrepreneurship); adds inventing and entrepreneurship as a means to apply STEM to real-world problem-solving and markets.\n[\n27\n]\nSTEMM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine)\n[\n28\n]\nSTM (scientific, technical, and mathematics\n[\n29\n]\nor science, technology, and medicine)\n[\n30\n]\nSTREAM (science, technology, robotics, engineering, arts, and mathematics); adds robotics and arts as fields\n[\n31\n]\nSTREAM (science, technology, reading, engineering, arts, and mathematics); adds reading and arts\n[\n32\n]\nSTREAM (science, technology, recreation, engineering, arts, and mathematics); adds recreation and arts\n[\n33\n]\nGeographic distribution\n[\nedit\n]\nSTEM graduates by country (2020)\n[\n34\n]\nRank\nCountry\nNumber of STEM grads\nPercent of total grads\n1\nChina\n3,570,000\n41%\n2\nIndia\n2,550,000\n30%\n3\nUnited States\n820,000\n20%\n4\nRussia\n520,000\n37%\n5\nIndonesia\n300,000\n20%\n6\nBrazil\n238,000\n17%\n7\nMexico\n221,000\n26%\n8\nFrance\n220,000\n26%\n9\nGermany\n216,000\n36%\n10\nIran\n211,000\n33%\n11\nJapan\n192,000\n19%\nBy the mid-2000s, China surpassed the United States in the number of PhDs awarded and is expected to produce 77,000 PhDs in 2025, compared to 40,000 in the US.\n[\n35\n]\nBy country\n[\nedit\n]\nAustralia\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Australian Curriculum, Assessment, and Reporting Authority 2015 report entitled,\nNational STEM School Education Strategy\n, stated that \"A renewed national focus on STEM in school education is critical to ensuring that all young Australians are equipped with the necessary STEM skills and knowledge that they must need to succeed.\"\n[\n36\n]\nIts goals were to:\n\"Ensure all students finish school with strong foundational knowledge in STEM and related skills\"\n[\n36\n]\n\"Ensure that students are inspired to take on more challenging STEM subjects\"\n[\n36\n]\nEvents and programs meant to help develop STEM in Australian schools include the\nVictorian Model Solar Vehicle Challenge\n, the Maths Challenge (Australian Mathematics Trust),\n[\n37\n]\nGo Girl Go Global\n[\n37\n]\nand the Australian Informatics Olympiad.\n[\n37\n]\nCanada\n[\nedit\n]\nCanada ranks 12th out of 16 peer countries in the percentage of its graduates who studied in STEM programs, with 21.2%, a number higher than the United States, but lower than\nFrance\n,\nGermany\n, and\nAustria\n. The peer country with the greatest proportion of STEM graduates,\nFinland\n, has over 30% of its university graduates coming from science, mathematics, computer science, and engineering programs.\n[\n38\n]\nSHAD is an annual Canadian summer enrichment program for high-achieving\nhigh school\nstudents in July. The program focuses on academic learning, particularly in\nSTEAM fields\n.\n[\n39\n]\nScouts Canada\nhas taken similar measures to their American counterpart to promote STEM fields to youth. Their STEM program began in 2015.\n[\n40\n]\nIn 2011 Canadian entrepreneur and philanthropist\nSeymour Schulich\nestablished the\nSchulich Leader Scholarships\n, $100 million in $60,000 scholarships for students beginning their university education in a STEM program at 20 institutions across Canada. Each year 40 Canadian students would be selected to receive the award, two at each institution, with the goal of attracting gifted youth into the STEM fields.\n[\n41\n]\nThe program also supplies STEM scholarships to five participating universities in\nIsrael\n.\n[\n42\n]\nFurther information:\nScience Expo\nChina\n[\nedit\n]\nMiddle school chemistry on a blackboard in Beijing, China, 2011\nTo promote STEM in China, the Chinese government issued a guideline in 2016 on national innovation-driven development strategy, \"instructing that by 2020, China should become an innovative country; by 2030, it should be at the forefront of innovative countries; and by 2050, it should become a technology innovation power.\"\n[\n43\n]\n\"[I]n May 2018, the launching ceremony and press conference for the 2029 Action Plan for China's STEM Education was held in Beijing, China. This plan aims to allow as many students to benefit from STEM education as possible and equip all students with scientific thinking and the ability to innovate.\" \"In response to encouraging policies by the government, schools in both public and private sectors around the country have begun to carry out STEM education programs.\"\n[\n44\n]\n\"However, to effectively implement STEM curricula, full-time teachers specializing in STEM education and relevant content to be taught are needed.\" Currently, \"China lacks qualified STEM teachers and a training system is yet to be established.\"\n[\n44\n]\nSeveral Chinese cities have made programming a mandatory subject for elementary and middle school students. This is the case of the city of Chongqing.\n[\n45\n]\nHowever, most students from small and medium-sized cities have not been exposed to the concept of STEM until they enter college.\n[\n46\n]\nEurope\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nSTEMNET (an educational charity in the UK)\nSeveral European projects have promoted STEM education and careers in Europe. For instance, Scientix\n[\n47\n]\nis a European cooperation of STEM teachers, education scientists, and policymakers. The SciChallenge\n[\n48\n]\nproject used a social media contest and student-generated content to increase the motivation of pre-university students for STEM education and careers. The\nErasmus programme\nproject AutoSTEM\n[\n49\n]\nused automata to introduce STEM subjects to very young children.\nFinland\n[\nedit\n]\nThe LUMA Center is the leading advocate for STEM-oriented education. Its aim is to promote the instruction and research of natural sciences, mathematics, computer science, and technology across all educational levels in the country. In the native tongue\nluma\nstands for \"luonnontieteellis-matemaattinen\" (lit. adj. \"scientific-mathematical\").\n[\n50\n]\nThe short is more or less a direct translation of\nSTEM\n, with engineering fields included by association. However, unlike STEM, the term is also a\nportmanteau\nfrom\nlu\nand\nma\n. To address the decline in interest in learning the areas of science, the Finnish National Board of Education launched the LUMA scientific education development program. The project's main goal was to raise the level of Finnish education and to enhance students' competencies, improve educational practices, and foster interest in science. The initiative led to the establishment of 13 LUMA centers at universities across Finland supervised by LUMA Center.\nFrance\n[\nedit\n]\nThe name of STEM in France is industrial engineering sciences (sciences industrielles or sciences de l'ingénieur). The STEM organization in France is the association UPSTI.\n[\nclarification needed\n]\nHong Kong\n[\nedit\n]\nSTEM education has not been promoted among the local schools in Hong Kong until recent years. In November 2015, the Education Bureau of Hong Kong released a document titled\nPromotion of STEM Education\n,\n[\n51\n]\nwhich proposes strategies and recommendations for promoting STEM education.\nIndia\n[\nedit\n]\nMedalists from Team India at the 2019\nInternational Physics Olympiad\nIndia is next only to China with STEM graduates per population of 1 to 52. The total number of fresh STEM graduates was 2.6 million in 2016.\n[\n52\n]\nSTEM graduates have been contributing to the Indian economy with well-paid salaries locally and abroad for the past two decades. The turnaround of the Indian economy with comfortable foreign exchange reserves is mainly attributed to the skills of its STEM graduates. In India, women make up an impressive 43% of STEM graduates, the highest percentage worldwide. However, they hold only 14% of STEM-related jobs. Additionally, among the 280,000 scientists and engineers working in research and development institutes in the country, women represent a mere 14%\n[\n53\n]\nIn India, OMOTEC is providing an innovative curriculum based on STEM, and their students are also performing and developing products to solve the new age problems.\n[\n54\n]\nTwo students also won the Microsoft Imagine Cup for developing a non-invasive method to screen for skin cancer using artificial intelligence.\n[\n55\n]\nNigeria\n[\nedit\n]\nIn Nigeria, the Association of Professional Women Engineers Of Nigeria (APWEN) has involved girls between the ages of 12 and 19 in science-based courses in order for them to pursue science-based courses in higher institutions of learning. The National Science Foundation (NSF) In Nigeria has made conscious efforts to encourage girls to innovate, invent, and build through the \"invent it, build it\" program sponsored by NNPC.\n[\n56\n]\nPakistan\n[\nedit\n]\nSTEM subjects are taught in Pakistan as part of electives taken in the 9th and 10th grades, culminating in\nMatriculation\nexams. These electives are pure sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology), mathematics (Physics, Chemistry, Maths), and computer science (Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science). STEM subjects are also offered as electives taken in the 11th and 12th grades, more commonly referred to as first and second year, culminating in\nIntermediate\nexams. These electives are FSc pre-\nmedical\n(Physics, Chemistry, Biology), FSc pre-\nengineering\n(Physics, Chemistry, Maths), and ICS (Physics/Statistics, Computer Science, Maths). These electives are intended to aid students in pursuing STEM-related careers in the future by preparing them for the study of these courses at university.\nA STEM education project has been approved by the government\n[\n57\n]\nto establish STEM labs in public schools. The\nMinistry of Information Technology and Telecommunication\nhas collaborated with Google to launch Pakistan's first grassroots-level Coding Skills Development Program,\n[\n58\n]\nbased on Google's CS First Program, a global initiative aimed at developing coding skills in children. The program aims to develop applied coding skills using gamification techniques for children between the ages of 9 and 14.\nThe KPITBs Early Age Programming initiative,\n[\n59\n]\nestablished in the province of\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa\n, has been successfully introduced in 225 Elementary and Secondary Schools. Many private organizations are working in Pakistan to introduce STEM education in schools.\nPhilippines\n[\nedit\n]\nIn the\nPhilippines\n, STEM is a two-year program and strand that is used for Senior High School (Grades 11 and 12), assigned by the\nDepartment of Education\nor DepEd. The STEM strand is under the Academic Track, which also includes other strands like ABM, HUMSS, and GAS.\n[\n60\n]\n[\n61\n]\nThe purpose of the STEM strand is to educate students in the field of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, in an interdisciplinary and applied approach, and to give students advanced knowledge and application in the field. After completing the program, the students will earn a Diploma in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. In some colleges and universities, they require students applying for STEM degrees (like medicine, engineering, computer studies, etc.) to be a graduate of STEM, if not, they will need to enter a bridging program.\nQatar\n[\nedit\n]\nIn\nQatar\n,\nAL-Bairaq\nis an outreach program to high-school students with a curriculum that focuses on STEM, run by the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) at\nQatar University\n. Each year around 946 students, from about 40 high schools, participate in AL-Bairaq competitions.\n[\n62\n]\nAL-Bairaq makes use of project-based learning, encourages students to solve authentic problems, and inquires them to work with each other as a team to build real solutions.\n[\n63\n]\n[\n64\n]\nResearch has so far shown positive results for the program.\n[\n65\n]\nSingapore\n[\nedit\n]\nSTEM is part of the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) that the Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) has been promoting since 2013, and currently, all secondary schools have such a program. It is expected that by 2023, all primary schools in Singapore will have an ALP. There are no tests or exams for ALPs. The emphasis is for students to learn through experimentation – they try, fail, try, learn from it, and try again. The MOE actively supports schools with ALPs to further enhance and strengthen their capabilities and programs that nurture innovation and creativity.\nThe Singapore Science Centre established a STEM unit in January 2014, dedicated to igniting students' passion for STEM. To further enrich students' learning experiences, their Industrial Partnership Programme (IPP) creates opportunities for students to get early exposure to real-world STEM industries and careers. Curriculum specialists and STEM educators from the Science Centre will work hand-in-hand with teachers to co-develop STEM lessons, provide training to teachers, and co-teach such lessons to provide students with early exposure and develop their interest in STEM.\nThailand\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 2017, Thai Education Minister Teerakiat Jareonsettasin said after the 49th Southeast Asia Ministers of Education Organisation (SEAMEO) Council Conference in Jakarta that the meeting approved the establishment of two new SEAMEO regional centers in Thailand. One would be the STEM Education Centre, while the other would be a Sufficient Economy Learning Centre.\n[\n66\n]\nTeerakiat said that the Thai government had already allocated Bt250 million over five years for the new STEM center. The center will be the regional institution responsible for STEM education promotion. It will not only set up policies to improve STEM education, but it will also be the center for information and experience sharing among the member countries and education experts. According to him, \"This is the first SEAMEO regional center for STEM education, as the existing science education center in Malaysia only focuses on the academic perspective. Our STEM education center will also prioritize the implementation and adaptation of science and technology.\"\n[\n67\n]\nThe Institute for the Promotion of Teaching Science and Technology has initiated a STEM Education Network. Its goals are to promote\nintegrated learning\nactivities improve student creativity and application of knowledge, and establish a network of organations and personnel for the promotion of STEM education in the country.\n[\n68\n]\nTurkey\n[\nedit\n]\nTurkish STEM Education Task Force (or FeTeMM—Fen Bilimleri, Teknoloji, Mühendislik ve Matematik) is a coalition of academicians and teachers who show an effort to increase the quality of education in STEM fields rather than focussing on increasing the number of STEM graduates.\n[\n69\n]\n[\n70\n]\nUnited States\n[\nedit\n]\nA high school student explains her engineering project to a judge in\nSacramento, California\n, in 2015.\nIn the United States, the acronym began to be used in education and immigration debates in initiatives to begin to address the perceived lack of qualified candidates for high-tech jobs. It also addresses concern that the subjects are often taught in isolation, instead of as an integrated curriculum.\n[\n71\n]\nMaintaining a citizenry that is well-versed in the STEM fields is a key portion of the\npublic education\nagenda of the United States.\n[\n72\n]\nThe acronym has been widely used in the immigration debate regarding access to United States\nwork visas\nfor\nimmigrants\nwho are skilled in these fields. It has also become commonplace in education discussions as a reference to the shortage of skilled workers and inadequate education in these areas.\n[\n73\n]\nThe term tends not to refer to the non-professional and less visible sectors of the fields, such as electronics assembly line work.\nNational Science Foundation\n[\nedit\n]\nMany organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the\nNational Science Foundation\non what constitutes a STEM field. The NSF uses a broad definition of STEM subjects that includes subjects in the fields of\nchemistry\n,\ncomputer\nand\ninformation technology\nscience, engineering, geoscience, life sciences, mathematical sciences, physics and astronomy,\nsocial sciences\n(\nanthropology\n,\neconomics\n,\npsychology\n, and\nsociology\n), and STEM education and learning research.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n74\n]\nThe NSF is the only American federal agency whose mission includes support for all fields of fundamental science and engineering, except for medical sciences.\n[\n75\n]\nIts disciplinary program areas include scholarships, grants, and fellowships in fields such as biological sciences, computer and\ninformation science\nand engineering, education and human resources, engineering, environmental research and education, geoscience, international science and engineering, mathematical and physical sciences, social, behavioral and economic sciences, cyberinfrastructure, and polar programs.\n[\n74\n]\nImmigration policy\n[\nedit\n]\nAlthough many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the\nNational Science Foundation\non what constitutes a STEM field, the\nUnited States Department of Homeland Security\n(DHS) has its own functional definition used for immigration policy.\n[\n76\n]\nIn 2012, DHS or ICE announced an expanded list of STEM-designated degree programs that qualify eligible graduates on student visas for an optional practical training (OPT) extension. Under the OPT program, international students who graduate from colleges and universities in the United States can stay in the country and receive up to twelve months of training through work experience. Students who graduate from a designated STEM degree program can stay for an additional seventeen months on an OPT STEM extension.\n[\n77\n]\n[\n78\n]\nAs of 2023, the U.S. faces a shortage of high-skilled workers in STEM, and foreign talents must navigate difficult hurdles to immigrate. Meanwhile, some other countries, such as Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, have introduced programs to attract talent at the expense of the United States.\n[\n79\n]\nIn the case of China, the United States risks losing its edge over\na strategic rival\n.\n[\n80\n]\nEducation\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nMathematics education in the United States\nBy cultivating an interest in the natural and social sciences in preschool or immediately following school entry, the chances of STEM success in high school can be greatly improved.\n[\n81\n]\nIn his 2012 budget, President Barack Obama renamed and broadened the \"Mathematics and Science Partnership (MSP)\" to award block grants to states for improving teacher education in those subjects.\n[\n82\n]\nCalculus AB\nand\nStatistics\nare two of the most popular\nAdvanced Placement\n(AP) exams, as of 2025.\n[\n83\n]\nMost AP exams in STEM saw an increase in the number of takers between 2018 and 2024.\nStudents with the highest standardized test scores commonly pick the STEM subjects as their majors while those with the lowest were more likely to choose education and agriculture.\n[\n84\n]\nDuring the 2010s, STEM has grown in popularity at the expense of the liberal arts and humanities.\nHealthcare and STEM, especially computer science, grew in popularity while the liberal arts and social studies, especially history, have declined due to market forces.\n[\n85\n]\n[\n86\n]\nSTEM education often uses new technologies such as\n3D printers\nto encourage interest in STEM fields.\n[\n87\n]\nSTEM education can also leverage the combination of new technologies, such as\nphotovoltaics\nand\nenvironmental sensors\n, with old technologies such as\ncomposting\nsystems and\nirrigation\nwithin\nland lab\nenvironments.\nIn 2006 the\nUnited States National Academies\nexpressed their concern about the declining state of STEM education in the United States. Its Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy developed a list of 10 actions. Their top three recommendations were to:\nIncrease America's talent pool by improving K–12 science and mathematics education\nStrengthen the skills of teachers through additional training in science, mathematics, and technology\nEnlarge the pipeline of students prepared to enter college and graduate with STEM degrees\n[\n88\n]\nThe\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nalso has implemented programs and curricula to advance STEM education to replenish the pool of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians who will lead space exploration in the 21st century.\n[\n88\n]\nIndividual states, such as\nCalifornia\n, have run pilot after-school STEM programs to learn what the most promising practices are and how to implement them to increase the chance of student success.\n[\n89\n]\nAnother state to invest in STEM education is Florida, where Florida Polytechnic University,\n[\n90\n]\nFlorida's first public university for engineering and technology dedicated to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), was established.\n[\n91\n]\nDuring school, STEM programs have been established for many districts throughout the U.S. Some states include\nNew Jersey\n,\nArizona\n,\nVirginia\n,\nNorth Carolina\n,\nTexas\n, and\nOhio\n.\n[\n92\n]\n[\n93\n]\nContinuing STEM education has expanded to the post-secondary level through masters programs such as the University of Maryland's STEM Program\n[\n94\n]\nas well as the University of Cincinnati.\n[\n95\n]\nRacial gap in STEM fields\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nRacial minorities in STEM fields\nSignificant race or sex differences exist in the completion of Algebra I.\n[\n96\n]\nIn the United States, the National Science Foundation found that the average science score on the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress was lower for black and Hispanic students than for white, Asian, and Pacific Islanders.\n[\n97\n]\nIn 2011, eleven percent of the U.S. workforce was black, while only six percent of STEM workers were black.\n[\n98\n]\nThough STEM in the U.S. has typically been dominated by white males, there have been considerable efforts to create initiatives to make STEM a more racially and gender-diverse field.\n[\n99\n]\nSome evidence suggests that all students, including black and Hispanic students, have a better chance of earning a STEM degree if they attend a college or university at which their entering academic credentials are at least as high as the average student's.\n[\n100\n]\nGender gaps in STEM\n[\nedit\n]\nAlthough women make up 47% of the workforce\n[\n101\n]\nin the U.S., they hold only 24% of STEM jobs. Research suggests that exposing girls to female inventors at a young age has the potential to reduce the gender gap in technical STEM fields by half.\n[\n102\n]\nCampaigns from organizations like the\nNational Inventors Hall of Fame\naimed to achieve a 50/50 gender balance in their youth STEM programs by 2020.\nIntersectionality in STEM\n[\nedit\n]\nSTEM fields have been recognized as areas where underrepresentation and exclusion of marginalized groups are prevalent. STEM poses unique challenges related to\nintersectionality\ndue to rigid norms and\nstereotypes\n, both in\nhigher education\nand professional settings. These norms often prioritize objectivity and\nmeritocracy\nwhile overlooking structural inequities, creating environments where individuals with intersecting marginalized identities face compounded barriers.\nFor instance, individuals from traditionally underrepresented groups may experience a phenomenon known as \"chilly climates\" which refers to incidents of\nsexism\n, isolation, and pressure to prove themselves to peers and high level academics.\n[\n103\n]\nFor minority populations in STEM, loneliness is experienced due to lack of belonging and\nsocial\nisolation.\n[\n104\n]\nAmerican Competitiveness Initiative\n[\nedit\n]\nIn the\nState of the Union Address\non January 31, 2006, President\nGeorge W. Bush\nannounced the\nAmerican Competitiveness Initiative\n. Bush proposed the initiative to address shortfalls in federal government support of educational development and progress at all academic levels in the STEM fields. In detail, the initiative called for significant increases in federal funding for advanced\nR&D\nprograms (including a doubling of federal funding support for advanced research in the physical sciences through\nDOE\n) and an increase in U.S. higher education graduates within STEM disciplines.\nThe\nNASA Means Business\ncompetition, sponsored by the Texas Space Grant Consortium, furthers that goal. College students compete to develop promotional plans to encourage students in middle and high school to study STEM subjects and to inspire professors in STEM fields to involve their students in outreach activities that support STEM education.\nThe\nNational Science Foundation\nhas numerous programs in STEM education, including some for K–12 students such as the ITEST Program that supports The Global Challenge Award ITEST Program. STEM programs have been implemented in some\nArizona\nschools. They implement higher cognitive skills for students and enable them to inquire and use techniques used by professionals in the STEM fields.\nProject Lead The Way\n(PLTW) is a provider of STEM education curricular programs to middle and high schools in the United States. Programs include a high school engineering curriculum called\nPathway To Engineering\n, a high school biomedical sciences program, and a middle school engineering and technology program called\nGateway To Technology\n. PLTW programs have been endorsed by President\nBarack Obama\nand\nUnited States Secretary of Education\nArne Duncan\nas well as various state, national, and business leaders.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nSTEM Education Coalition\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education Coalition\n[\n105\n]\nworks to support STEM programs for teachers and students at the\nU.S. Department of Education\n, the\nNational Science Foundation\n, and other agencies that offer STEM-related programs. Activity of the STEM Coalition seems to have slowed since September 2008.\nFounded in 2001,\nSTEM.org\nEducational Research™ is a private organization that operates a global trustmark framework for STEM education. Its credentialing system, which includes distinctions for educational programs, products, and professionals, is used to verify STEM authenticity and quality in over 80 countries.\n[\n106\n]\nScouting\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 2012, the\nBoy Scouts of America\nbegan handing out awards, titled NOVA and SUPERNOVA, for completing specific requirements appropriate to the scouts' program level in each of the four main STEM areas. The\nGirl Scouts of the USA\nhas similarly incorporated STEM into their program through the introduction of merit badges such as \"Naturalist\" and \"Digital Art\".\n[\n107\n]\nSAE\nis an international organization, and provider specializing in supporting education, award, and scholarship programs for STEM matters, from pre-K to college degrees.\n[\n108\n]\nIt also promotes scientific and technological innovation.\nDepartment of Defense programs\n[\nedit\n]\n[\n109\n]\neCybermission\nis a free, web-based science, mathematics, and technology competition for students in grades six through nine sponsored by the U.S. Army.

CyberGuides are military and civilian volunteers with a strong background in STEM and STEM education, who can provide insight into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to students and team advisers.\nSTARBASE\nis an educational program, sponsored by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs. Students interact with military personnel to explore careers and make connections with the \"real world\". The program provides students with 20–25 hours of experience at\nthe National Guard\n,\nNavy\n,\nMarines\n,\nAir Force Reserve\n, and\nAir Force\nbases across the nation.\nSeaPerch\nis an underwater robotics program that trains teachers to teach their students how to build an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in an in-school or out-of-school setting. Students build the ROV from a kit composed of low-cost, easily accessible parts, following a curriculum that teaches basic engineering and science concepts with a marine engineering theme.\nNASA\n[\nedit\n]\nSTEM Girls' Night In at the NASA's\nGoddard Space Flight Center\n, Greenbelt, Maryland (2018)\nNASAStem is a program of the U.S.\nspace agency\nNASA\nto increase diversity within its ranks, including age, disability, and gender as well as race/ethnicity.\n[\n110\n]\nLegislation\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nAmerica COMPETES Act\n(P.L. 110–69) became law on August 9, 2007. It is intended to increase the nation's investment in science and engineering research and in STEM education from kindergarten to graduate school and postdoctoral education. The act authorizes funding increases for the\nNational Science Foundation\n,\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology\nlaboratories, and the\nDepartment of Energy\n(DOE) Office of Science over FY2008–FY2010. Robert Gabrys, Director of Education at NASA's\nGoddard Space Flight Center\n, articulated success as increased student achievement, early expression of student interest in STEM subjects, and student preparedness to enter the workforce.\nJobs\n[\nedit\n]\nIn November 2012 the\nWhite House\nannouncement before the congressional vote on the STEM Jobs Act put President Obama in opposition to many of the Silicon Valley firms and executives who bankrolled his re-election campaign.\n[\n111\n]\nThe Department of Labor identified 14 sectors that are \"projected to add substantial numbers of new jobs to\nthe economy\nor affect the growth of other industries or are being transformed by technology and innovation requiring new sets of skills for workers.\"\n[\n112\n]\nThe identified sectors were as follows: advanced manufacturing,\nAutomotive\n,\nconstruction\n,\nfinancial services\n,\ngeospatial technology\n,\nhomeland security\n,\ninformation technology\n,\nTransportation\n,\nAerospace\n,\nBiotechnology\n,\nenergy\n,\nhealthcare\n,\nhospitality\n, and\nretail\n.\nThe\nDepartment of Commerce\nnotes STEM fields careers are some of the best-paying and have the greatest potential for job growth in the early 21st century. The report also notes that STEM workers play a key role in the sustained growth and stability of the U.S. economy, and training in STEM fields generally results in higher wages, whether or not they work in a STEM field.\n[\n113\n]\nIn 2015, there were around 9.0 million STEM jobs in the United States, representing 6.1% of American employment. STEM jobs were increasing by around 9% percent per year.\n[\n114\n]\nBrookings Institution found that the demand for competent technology graduates will surpass the number of capable applicants by at least one million individuals.\nAccording to Pew Research Center, a typical STEM worker earns two-thirds more than those employed in other fields.\n[\n115\n]\nRecent progress\n[\nedit\n]\nAccording to the 2014 US census \"74 percent of those who have a bachelor's degree in science, technology, engineering and math — commonly referred to as STEM — are not employed in STEM occupations.\"\n[\n116\n]\n[\n117\n]\nIn September 2017, several large American technology firms collectively pledged to donate $300 million for computer science education in the U.S.\n[\n118\n]\nPEW findings revealed in 2018 that Americans identified several issues that hound STEM education which included unconcerned parents, disinterested students, obsolete curriculum materials, and too much focus on state parameters. 57 percent of survey respondents pointed out that one main problem of STEM is the lack of students' concentration in learning.\n[\n119\n]\nThe recent National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) report card\n[\n120\n]\nmade public technology as well as engineering literacy scores which determines whether students can apply technology and engineering proficiency to real-life scenarios. The report showed a gap of 28 points between low-income students and their high-income counterparts. The same report also indicated a 38-point difference between white and black students.\n[\n121\n]\nThe Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC) announced the release of a five-year strategic plan by the Committee on STEM Education of the National Science and Technology Council on December 4, 2018. The plan is entitled \"Charting a Course for Success: America's Strategy for STEM Education.\"\n[\n122\n]\nThe objective is to propose a federal strategy anchored on a vision for the future so that all Americans are given permanent access to premium-quality education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. In the end, the United States can emerge as a world leader in STEM mastery, employment, and innovation. The goals of this plan are building foundations for STEM literacy; enhancing diversity, equality, and inclusion in STEM; and preparing the STEM workforce for the future.\n[\n123\n]\nThe 2019 fiscal budget proposal of the White House supported the funding plan in President Donald Trump's Memorandum on STEM Education which allocated around $200 million (grant funding) for STEM education every year. This budget also supports STEM through a grant program worth $20 million for career as well as technical education programs.\n[\n124\n]\nEvents and programs to help develop STEM in US schools\n[\nedit\n]\nFIRST Tech Challenge\nVEX Robotics Competitions\nFIRST Robotics Competition\nVietnam\n[\nedit\n]\nIn Vietnam, beginning in 2012 many private education organizations have STEM education initiatives.\nIn 2015, the Ministry of Science and Technology and Liên minh STEM organized the first National STEM Day, followed by many similar events across the country.\nin 2015, the Ministry of Education and Training included STEM as an area that needed to be encouraged in the national school year program.\nIn May 2017, the\nPrime Minister\nsigned a Directive No. 16\n[\n125\n]\nstating: \"Dramatically change the policies, contents, education and vocational training methods to create a human resource capable of receiving new production technology trends, with a focus on promoting training in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), foreign languages, information technology in general education; \" and asking \"Ministry of Education and Training (to): Promote the deployment of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education in general education program; Pilot organize in some high schools from 2017 to 2018.\nZimbawe\n[\nedit\n]\nThe gender gap in Zimbabwe's STEM fields is significant, with only 28.79% of women holding STEM degrees compared to 71.21% of men.\n[\n126\n]\nWomen\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nFemale education in STEM\nand\nWomen in STEM fields\nSee also:\nWomen in science\n,\nWomen in engineering\n,\nWomen in computing\n,\nSex differences in psychology\n, and\nSex differences in intelligence\nWomen constitute 47% of the U.S. workforce and perform 24% of STEM-related jobs.\n[\n127\n]\nIn the UK women perform 13% of STEM-related jobs (2014).\n[\n128\n]\nIn the U.S. women with STEM degrees are more likely to work in education or healthcare rather than STEM fields compared with their male counterparts.\nImage of participants of NASA Goddard's STEM Girls Night in 2018\nThe gender ratio depends on the field of study. For example, in the\nEuropean Union\nin 2012 women made up 47.3% of the total, 51% of the social sciences, business, and law, 42% of the science, mathematics, and computing, 28% of engineering, manufacturing, and construction, and 59% of PhD graduates in Health and Welfare.\n[\n129\n]\nIn a study from 2019, it was shown that part of the success of women in STEM depends on the way women in STEM are viewed. In a study that researched grants given based primarily on a project versus primarily based on the project lead there was almost no difference in the evaluation between projects from men or women when evaluated on the project, but those evaluated mainly on the project leader showed that projects headed by women were given grants four percent less often.\n[\n130\n]\nImproving the experiences of women in STEM is a major component of increasing the number of women in STEM. One part of this includes the need for role models and mentors who are women in STEM. Along with this, having good resources for information and networking opportunities can improve women's ability to flourish in STEM fields.\n[\n131\n]\nA 2018 study suggested the propensity for women to pursue college degrees in STEM fields declines consistently as countries become more wealthy and egalitarian.\n[\n132\n]\nHowever, a 2019 correction to the study outlined that the authors had created a previously undisclosed and unvalidated method to measure \"propensity\" of women and men to attain a higher degree in STEM, as opposed to the originally claimed measurement of \"women's share of STEM degrees.\"\n[\n133\n]\n[\n134\n]\nHarvard researchers were unable to recreate the results of the study, thus highlighting problems with the interpretation of the data in the original paper.\n[\n135\n]\n[\n136\n]\nLGBTQ+\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nLGBT people in science\nPeople identifying within the group LGBTQ+ have faced discrimination in STEM fields throughout history. Few were openly queer in STEM; however, a couple of well-known people are\nAlan Turing\n, the father of computer science, and\nSara Josephine Baker\n, an American physician and public-health leader.\n[\n137\n]\nDespite recent changes in attitudes towards LGBTQ+ people, discrimination still permeates throughout STEM fields.\n[\n138\n]\n[\n139\n]\nA recent study has shown that sexual minority students were less likely to have completed a bachelor's degree in a STEM field,\n[\n140\n]\n[\n141\n]\nhaving opted to switch their major. Those that remained in a STEM field were however more likely to participate in undergraduate research programs. According to the study sexual minorities did show higher overall retention rates within STEM related fields as compared to heterosexual women.\n[\n140\n]\n[\n139\n]\nAnother study concluded that queer people are more likely to experience exclusion, harassment, and other negative impacts while in a STEM career while also having fewer opportunities and resources available to them.\n[\n142\n]\nMultiple programs and institutions are working towards increasing the inclusion and acceptance of LGBTQ+ people in STEM. In the US, the National Organization of Gay and Lesbian Scientists and Technical Professionals (NOGLSTP) has organized people to address homophobia since the 1980s and now promotes activism and support for queer scientists.\n[\n143\n]\nOther programs, including 500 Queer Scientists and Pride in STEM, function as visibility campaigns for LGBTQ+ people in STEM worldwide.\n[\n143\n]\n[\n144\n]\nCriticism\n[\nedit\n]\nThe focus on increasing participation in STEM fields has attracted criticism. In the 2014 article \"The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage\" in\nThe Atlantic\n, demographer\nMichael S. Teitelbaum\ncriticized the efforts of the U.S. government to increase the number of STEM graduates, saying that, among studies on the subject, \"No one has been able to find any evidence indicating current widespread labor market shortages or hiring difficulties in science and engineering occupations that require bachelor's degrees or higher\", and that \"Most studies report that real wages in many—but not all—science and engineering occupations have been flat or slow-growing, and unemployment as high or higher than in many comparably-skilled occupations.\" Teitelbaum also wrote that the then-current national fixation on increasing STEM participation paralleled previous U.S. government efforts since\nWorld War II\nto increase the number of scientists and engineers, all of which he stated ultimately ended up in \"mass layoffs, hiring freezes, and funding cuts\"; including one driven by the\nSpace Race\nof the late 1950s and 1960s, which he wrote led to \"a bust of serious magnitude in the 1970s.\"\n[\n145\n]\nAccording to the\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\n, various STEM occupational outlooks have shown slowing growth or declines for several years.\n[\n146\n]\nIEEE Spectrum\ncontributing editor Robert N. Charette echoed these sentiments in the 2013 article \"The STEM Crisis Is a Myth\", also noting that there was a \"mismatch between earning a STEM degree and having a STEM job\" in the United States, with only around\n1\n⁄\n4\nof STEM graduates working in STEM fields, while less than half of workers in STEM fields have a STEM degree.\n[\n147\n]\nEconomics writer\nBen Casselman\n, in a 2014 study of post-graduation earnings in the United States for\nFiveThirtyEight\n, wrote that, based on the data, science should not be grouped with the other three STEM categories, because, while the other three generally result in high-paying jobs, \"many sciences, particularly the\nlife sciences\n, pay below the overall median for recent college graduates.\"\n[\n148\n]\nA 2017 article from the\nUniversity of Leicester\nconcluded, that\n\"maintaining accounts of a 'crisis' in the supply of STEM workers has usually been in the interests of industry, the education\nsector and government, as well as the lobby groups that represent them. Concerns about a shortage have meant the allocation of significant additional resources to the sector whose representatives have, in turn, become powerful voices in advocating for further funds and further investment.\"\n[\n149\n]\nA 2022 report from\nRutgers University\nstated:\n\"In the United States, the STEM crisis theme is a perennial policy favorite, appearing every few years as an urgent concern in the nation's competition with whatever other nation is ascendant, or as the cause of whatever problem is ailing the domestic economy. And the solution is always the same: increase the supply of STEM workers through expanding STEM education. Time and again, serious and empirically grounded studies find little evidence of any systemic failures or an inability of market responses to address whatever supply is required to meet workforce needs.\"\n[\n150\n]\nA study of the UK job market, published in 2022, found similar problems, which have been reported for the USA earlier: \"It is not clear that having a degree in the sciences, rather than in other subjects, provides any sort of advantage in terms of short- or long-term employability... While only a minority of STEM graduates ever work in highly-skilled STEM jobs, we identified three particular characteristics of the STEM labour market that may present challenges for employers: STEM employment appears to be predicated on early\nentry to the sector; a large proportion of STEM graduates are likely to never work in the sector; and there may be more movement out of HS STEM positions by older workers than in other sectors... \"\n[\n151\n]\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nCareer and technical education\n– academic and technical skills for workforce preparation\nCraft Academy for Excellence in Science and Mathematics\nHard and soft science\nList of African American women in STEM fields\nMaker culture\nNASA RealWorld-InWorld Engineering Design Challenge\nNational Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)\nPre-STEM\nScience, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Network\nSociety of Hispanic Professional Engineers\n(SHPE)\nSTEM Academy\nSTEM.org\nSTEM pipeline\nTech ed\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\nPoláková, Michaela; Suleimanová, Juliet Horváthová; Madzík, Peter; Copuš, Lukáš; Molnárová, Ivana; Polednová, Jana (2023-08-01).\n\"Soft skills and their importance in the labour market under the conditions of Industry 5.0\"\n.\nHeliyon\n.\n9\n(8) e18670.\nBibcode\n:\n2023Heliy...918670P\n.\ndoi\n:\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e18670\n.\nISSN\n2405-8440\n.\nPMC\n10428053\n.\nPMID\n37593611\n.\n^\na\nb\nc\n\"Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education: A Primer\"\n(PDF)\n.\nFas.org\n.\nArchived\n(PDF)\nfrom the original on 2018-10-09\n.

It is bordered by\nVirginia\nto the north, the\nAtlantic Ocean\nto the east,\nSouth Carolina\nto the south,\nGeorgia\nto the southwest, and\nTennessee\nto the west. The state is the\n28th-largest\nand\nninth-most populous\nof the\nUnited States\n. Along with South Carolina, it makes up the\nCarolinas\nregion of the\nEast Coast\n. At the\n2020 census\n, the state had a population of 10,439,388.\n[\n9\n]\nRaleigh\nis the state's\ncapital\nand\nCharlotte\nis its\nmost populous\nand one of the fastest growing cities in the\nUnited States\n.\n[\n10\n]\nThe\nCharlotte metropolitan area\n, with an estimated population of 2,883,370 in 2024,\n[\n11\n]\nis the\nmost populous metropolitan area\nin North Carolina, the\n21st-most populous\nin the United States, and the largest banking center in the nation after New York City.\n[\n12\n]\nThe\nResearch Triangle\n, with an estimated population of 2,368,947 in 2023, is the second-most populous combined metropolitan area in the state,\n31st-most populous\nin the United States,\n[\n11\n]\nand is home to the largest research park in the United States,\nResearch Triangle Park\n.\nThe earliest evidence of human occupation in North Carolina dates back 10,000 years, found at the\nHardaway Site\n. North Carolina was inhabited by\nCarolina Algonquian\n,\nIroquoian\n, and\nSiouan\nspeaking tribes of Native Americans prior to the arrival of Europeans.\nKing Charles II\ngranted eight lord proprietors a colony they named Carolina after the king and which was established in 1670 with the first permanent settlement at Charles Town (now\nCharleston, South Carolina\n). Because of the difficulty of governing the entire colony from Charles Town, the colony was eventually divided and North Carolina was established as a\nroyal colony\nin 1729 and was one of the\nThirteen Colonies\n. The\nHalifax Resolves\nresolution adopted by North Carolina on April 12, 1776, was the first formal call for independence from Great Britain among the American Colonies during the\nAmerican Revolution\n.\n[\n13\n]\nOn November 21, 1789, North Carolina became the 12th state to ratify the\nUnited States Constitution\n. In the run-up to the\nAmerican Civil War\n, North Carolina declared its\nsecession\nfrom the\nUnion\non May 20, 1861, becoming the tenth of eleven states to join the\nConfederate States of America\n.\n[\n14\n]\nFollowing the Civil War, the state was restored to the Union on July 4, 1868.\n[\n15\n]\nOn December 17, 1903,\nOrville and Wilbur Wright\nsuccessfully piloted the world's first controlled, sustained flight of a powered,\nheavier-than-air aircraft\nat\nKitty Hawk\nin North Carolina's\nOuter Banks\n. North Carolina often uses the slogan \"First in Flight\" on state\nlicense plates\nto commemorate this achievement, alongside a newer alternative design bearing the slogan \"First in Freedom\" in reference to the\nMecklenburg Declaration\nand Halifax Resolves.\nNorth Carolina is defined by a wide range of elevations and landscapes. From west to east, North Carolina's elevation descends from the\nAppalachian Mountains\nto the\nPiedmont\nand\nAtlantic coastal plain\n. North Carolina's\nMount Mitchell\nat 6,684 ft (2,037 m) is the highest point in North America east of the\nBlack Hills\nSouth Dakota.\n[\n16\n]\nMost of the state falls in the\nhumid subtropical climate\nzone; however, the western, mountainous part of the state has a\nsubtropical highland climate\n.\n[\n17\n]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nHistory of North Carolina\nNative Americans, lost colony, and permanent settlement\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nNative Americans in the United States\n,\nJoara\n,\nRoanoke Island\n, and\nFort Raleigh National Historic Site\nCeremony of\nSecotan\nwarriors in North Carolina. Watercolour painted by English colonist\nJohn White\nin 1585.\nNorth Carolina was inhabited for at least 10,000 years by succeeding\nprehistoric\nIndigenous\ncultures. The\nHardaway Site\nsaw major periods of occupation dating to 10,000 years BCE. Before 200 AD, people were building\nearthwork\nplatform mounds\nfor ceremonial and religious purposes. Succeeding peoples, including those of the\nSouth Appalachian Mississippian culture\n, established by 1000 AD in the\nPiedmont\nand mountain region, continued to build this style of mounds. In contrast to some of the larger centers of the classic Mississippian culture in the area that became known as the western Carolinas, northeastern Georgia, and southeastern Tennessee, most of the larger towns had only one central platform mound. Smaller settlements had none, but were close to more prominent towns. This area became known as the homelands of the historic\nCherokee\npeople, who are believed to have migrated over time from the\nGreat Lakes\narea.\nIn the 500–700 years preceding European contact, the Mississippian culture built elaborate cities and maintained far-flung regional trading networks. Its largest city was\nCahokia\n, which had numerous mounds for different purposes, a highly stratified society, and was located in present-day southwestern Illinois near the Mississippi River. Starting in 1540, the Native polities of the Mississippian culture fell apart and reformed as new groups, such as the\nCatawba\n, due to a series of destabilizing events known as the \"\nMississippian shatter zone\n\". Introduction of colonial trading arrangements and hostile native groups from the north such as the Westo Indians hastened changes in an already tenuous regional hierarchy.\n[\n18\n]\nAs described by anthropologist\nRobbie Ethridge\n, the Mississippian shatter zone was a time of great instability in what is now the American South, caused by the instability of Mississippian chiefdoms, high mortality from new Eurasian diseases, conversion to an agricultural society and the accompanying population increase, and the emergence of Native \"militaristic slaving societies\".\n[\n19\n]\nHistorically documented tribes in the North Carolina region include the\nCarolina Algonquian\n-speaking tribes of the coastal areas, such as the\nChowanoc\n,\nRoanoke\n,\nPamlico\n,\nMachapunga\n, and\nCoree\n, who were the first encountered by the English; the\nIroquoian\n-speaking\nMeherrin\n,\nCherokee\n, and\nTuscarora\nof the interior; and Southeastern\nSiouan\n-speaking tribes, such as the\nCheraw\n,\nWaxhaw\n,\nSaponi\n,\nWaccamaw\n,\nCape Fear Indians\n, and\nCatawba\nof the Piedmont.\n[\n20\n]\n[\n21\n]\n[\n22\n]\n[\n23\n]\nThe first documented European exploration of the coast of present-day North Carolina was undertaken by the Florentine navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano, who sailed in the service of the French Crown. In 1524, during his expedition along the Atlantic coast of North America, Verrazzano visited and explored the region between present-day Cape Fear and Pamlico Sound, providing the first known European description of that area. The primary record of this voyage is the letter Verrazzano sent to King Francis I of France, preserved in several manuscript copies, including the Cèllère Codex, which describes in detail the geography, Indigenous peoples, and natural features of the explored coast.\nIn the late 16th century, the first Spanish explorers traveling inland recorded meeting\nMississippian culture\npeople at\nJoara\n, a regional\nchiefdom\nnear what later developed as\nMorganton\n.\n[\n24\n]\nRecords of\nHernando de Soto\nattested to his meeting with them in 1540. In 1567, Captain\nJuan Pardo\nled an expedition to claim the area for the Spanish colony and to establish another route to reach silver mines in Mexico.\n[\n25\n]\nPardo made a winter base at Joara, which he renamed\nCuenca\n.\n[\n26\n]\n[\n27\n]\nHis expedition built\nFort San Juan\nand left a contingent of 30 Spaniards there, while Pardo traveled further.\n[\n26\n]\nHis forces built and garrisoned five other forts. He returned by a different route to\nSanta Elena\non\nParris Island, South Carolina\n, then a center of\nSpanish Florida\n. In the spring of 1568, natives killed all but seventy four of the Spaniards and burned the six forts in the interior, including Fort San Juan.\n[\n28\n]\nAlthough the Spanish never returned to the interior, this effort marked the first European attempt at colonization of the interior of what became the United States. A 16th-century journal by Pardo's scribe Bandera, and\narchaeological\nfindings since 1986 at Joara, have confirmed the settlement.\n[\n29\n]\n[\n30\n]\nAnglo-European settlement\n[\nedit\n]\nSir Walter Raleigh\n, namesake of the state capital of North Carolina,\nRaleigh\nIn 1584,\nElizabeth I\ngranted a charter to\nSir Walter Raleigh\n, for whom the state capital is named, for land in present-day North Carolina (then part of the territory of\nVirginia\n).\n[\n31\n]\nIt was the second American territory that the English attempted to colonize. Raleigh established two colonies on the coast in the late 1580s, but both failed. The colony established in 1587 saw 118 colonists 'disappear' when\nJohn White\nwas unable to return from a supply run during battles with the\nSpanish Armada\n. The fate of the \"\nLost Colony\n\" of\nRoanoke Island\nremains one of the most widely debated mysteries of American history. Two native Chieftains,\nManteo\nand\nWanchese\n, of which the former helped the colonists and the latter was distrustful, had involvement in the colony and even accompanied Raleigh to England on a previous voyage in 1585. Manteo was also the first Indigenous North American to be baptized by English settlers. Upon White's return in 1590, neither native nor Englishman were to be found. Popular theory holds that the colonists either traveled away with or assimilated into local native culture.\n[\n32\n]\nVirginia Dare\n, the first English person to be born in North America, was born on Roanoke Island on August 18, 1587; the surrounding\nDare County\nis named for her.\nAs early as 1650, settlers from the\nVirginia colony\nhad moved into the\nAlbemarle Sound\nregion. By 1663, King\nCharles II of England\ngranted a\ncharter\nto start a new colony on the North American continent; this would generally establish North Carolina's borders. He named it\nCarolina\nin honor of his father,\nCharles\nI\n.\n[\n33\n]\nBy 1665, a second charter was issued to attempt to resolve territorial questions. This charter rewarded the\nLords Proprietors\n, eight Englishmen to whom King Charles II granted joint ownership of a tract of land in the state. All of these men either had remained loyal to the Crown or aided Charles's restoration to the English throne after\nCromwell\n. In 1712, owing to disputes over governance, the Carolina colony split into North Carolina and\nSouth Carolina\n. North Carolina became a crown colony in 1729.\n[\n34\n]\nMost of the English colonists\nhad arrived as\nindentured servants\n, hiring themselves out as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage. In the early years the line between indentured servants and African\nslaves\nor laborers was fluid. Some Africans were allowed to earn their freedom before slavery became a lifelong status. Most of the\nfree colored\nfamilies formed in North Carolina before the Revolution were descended from unions or marriages between free whites and enslaved or free Africans or African-Americans. If the mothers were free, their children were born free. Many had migrated or were descendants of migrants from colonial Virginia.\n[\n35\n]\nAs the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in\nGreat Britain\n, planters imported more slaves, and the state's legal delineations between free and slave status tightened, effectively hardening the latter into a racial caste. Conditions for both slaves and workers worsened as the ranks of the former eclipsed the latter and expansion of farming operations into former Indigenous territories lowered prices. Unable to establish deep water ports such as at Charles Town and Norfolk, the economy's growth and prosperity was thus based on cheap labor and slave plantation systems, devoted primarily to the production of tobacco, then later cotton and textiles.\n[\n36\n]\nIn\n1738–1739\n, smallpox caused high fatalities among the Native Americans, who had no\nimmunity\nto the new disease (it had become\nendemic\nover centuries in Europe).\n[\n37\n]\nAccording to the historian Russell Thornton, \"The 1738 epidemic was said to have killed one-half of the\nCherokee\n, with other tribes of the area suffering equally.\"\n[\n38\n]\nColonial period\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nProvince of Carolina\n,\nProvince of North-Carolina\n,\nFrench and Indian War\n,\nTreaty of Paris (1763)\n,\nAmerican Revolutionary War\n,\nUnited States Declaration of Independence\n, and\nArticles of Confederation § Ratification\nJohn White\nreturns to find the colony abandoned\nMap of the coast of\nVirginia\nand North Carolina, drawn 1585–1586 by\nTheodor de Bry\n, based on map by\nJohn White\nof the\nRoanoke Colony\nReconstructed royal governor's mansion\nTryon Palace\nin\nNew Bern\nAfter the Spanish in the 16th century, the first permanent European settlers of North Carolina were English colonists who migrated south from\nVirginia\n. Virginia had grown rapidly and land was less available.\nNathaniel Batts\nwas documented as one of the first of these Virginian migrants. He settled south of the\nChowan River\nand east of the\nGreat Dismal Swamp\nin 1655.\n[\n39\n]\nBy 1663, this northeastern area of the\nProvince of Carolina\n, known as the\nAlbemarle Settlements\n, was undergoing full-scale English settlement.\n[\n40\n]\nDuring the same period, the English monarch Charles\nII gave provincial land grants to the\nLords Proprietors\n, the group of noblemen who had helped restore him to the throne in 1660. These grants were predicated on an agreement that the Lords would use their influence to bring in colonists and establish ports of trade. This new\nProvince of Carolina\nwas named in honor and memory of his father, Charles\nI (Latin:\nCarolus\n).\nLacking a viable coastal port city due to geography, towns grew at a slower pace and remained small. By the late 17th century, Carolina was essentially two colonies, one centered in the Albemarle region in the north and the other located in the south around Charleston.\n[\n36\n]\nIn 1705 South Carolinian\nJohn Lawson\npurchased land on the Pamlico River and laid out\nBath\n, North Carolina's first town. After returning to England, he published the book A New Voyage to Carolina, which became a travelogue and a marketing piece to encourage new colonists to Carolina. Lawson encouraged Baron\nChristoph von Graffenried\n, the leader of a group of Swiss and German Protestants, to immigrate to Carolina. Von Graffenried purchased land between the Neuse and the Trent Rivers and established the town of\nNew Bern\n. After an attack on New Bern in which hundreds were killed or injured, Lawson was caught then executed by\nTuscarora Indians\n. A large revolt happened in the state in 1711, known as\nCary's Rebellion\n. In 1712, North Carolina became a separate colony, and in 1729 it became a royal colony, with the exception of the\nEarl Granville\nholdings.\n[\n41\n]\nIn June 1718,\nQueen Anne's Revenge\n, the flagship of pirate\nBlackbeard\n, ran aground at Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina, in present-day\nCarteret County\n. After the grounding, her crew and supplies were transferred to smaller ships. In November 1718, after appealing to the governor of North Carolina, who promised safe-haven and a pardon, Blackbeard was killed in an ambush by troops from Virginia.\n[\n42\n]\nIn 1996, Intersal, Inc., a private maritime research firm, discovered the remains of a vessel likely to be the\nQueen Anne's Revenge\n, which was added to the U.S.\nNational Register of Historic Places\n.\n[\n43\n]\n[\n44\n]\nNorth Carolina became one of the\nThirteen Colonies\nand with the territory of\nSouth Carolina\nwas originally known as the\nProvince of North Carolina\n. The northern and southern parts of the original province separated in 1712, with North Carolina becoming a royal colony in 1729. Originally settled by small farmers, sometimes having a few slaves, who were oriented toward\nsubsistence agriculture\n, the colony lacked large cities or towns.\nPirates\nmenaced the coastal settlements, but by 1718 piracy in the Carolinas was on the decline. Growth was strong in the middle of the 18th century, as the economy attracted\nScots-Irish\n,\nQuaker\n,\nEnglish\nand\nGerman\nimmigrants. A majority of the North Carolina colonists generally supported the\nAmerican Revolution\n, although there were some\nLoyalists\n. Loyalists in North Carolina were fewer in number than in some other colonies such as Georgia, South Carolina, Delaware, and New York.\n[\n45\n]\n[\n46\n]\n[\n47\n]\nDuring colonial times, Bath was the first provincial capital after the formation of North Carolina from the Province of Carolina in 1712, followed by\nEdenton\nbeginning in 1722, followed by\nNew Bern\nbecoming the capital in 1766. Construction of\nTryon Palace\n, which served as the residence and offices of the provincial governor\nWilliam Tryon\n, began in 1767 and was completed in 1771. In 1788,\nRaleigh\nwas chosen as the site of the new capital, as its central location protected it from coastal attacks. Officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital, the city was named after Sir\nWalter Raleigh\n, sponsor of\nRoanoke\n, the \"lost colony\" on\nRoanoke Island\n.\n[\n48\n]\nThe population of the colony more than quadrupled from 52,000 in 1740 to 270,000 in 1780 from high immigration from Virginia,\nMaryland\nand\nPennsylvania\n, plus immigrants from abroad.\n[\n49\n]\nNorth Carolina did not have any printer or print shops until 1749, when the North Carolina Assembly commissioned\nJames Davis\nfrom Williamsburg Virginia to act as their official printer.  Before this time the laws and legal journals of North Carolina were handwritten and were kept in a largely disorganized manner, prompting the hiring of Davis. Davis settled in New Bern, married, and in 1755 was appointed by\nBenjamin Franklin\nas North Carolina's first postmaster. In October of that year the North Carolina Assembly awarded Davis a contract to carry mail between\nWilmington, North Carolina\nand\nSuffolk, Virginia\n. He was also active in North Carolina politics as a member of the Assembly and later as the Sheriff. Davis also founded and printed the\nNorth-Carolina Gazette\n, North Carolina's first newspaper, printed in his printing house in New Bern.\n[\n50\n]\n[\n51\n]\nDifferences in the settlement patterns of eastern and western North Carolina, or the\nAtlantic coastal plain\nand uplands, affected the political, economic, and social life of the state from the 18th until the 20th century. Eastern North Carolina was settled chiefly by immigrants from rural England and Gaelic speakers from the\nScottish Highlands\n. The\nPiedmont\nupcountry and western mountain region of North Carolina was settled chiefly by\nScots-Irish\n, English, and German Protestants, the so-called \"\ncohee\n\". Arriving during the mid-to-late 18th century, the Scots-Irish, people of Scottish descent who migrated to and then emigrated from what is today Northern Ireland, were the largest non-English immigrant group before the Revolution; English indentured servants were overwhelmingly the largest immigrant group before the Revolution.\n[\n52\n]\n[\n53\n]\n[\n54\n]\n[\n55\n]\nRevolutionary War\n[\nedit\n]\nHalifax Resolves\nplaque inside the\nNorth Carolina State Capitol\nDuring the\nAmerican Revolutionary War\n, the English and Gaelic speaking Highland Scots of eastern North Carolina tended to remain loyal to the British Crown, because of longstanding business and personal connections with Great Britain. The English, Welsh, Scots-Irish, and German settlers of western North Carolina tended to favor American independence from Britain. British loyalists dubbed the\nMecklenburg County\narea to be 'a hornet's nest' of radicals, birthing the name of the future Charlotte NBA team. On April 12, 1776, the colony became the first to instruct its delegates to the\nContinental Congress\nto vote for independence from the British Crown, through the\nHalifax Resolves\npassed by the\nNorth Carolina Provincial Congress\n. The date of this event is memorialized on the\nstate flag\nand\nstate seal\n. Throughout the Revolutionary War, fierce\nguerrilla warfare\nerupted between bands of pro-independence and pro-British colonists. In some cases the war was also an excuse to settle private grudges and rivalries.\n[\n56\n]\n[\n57\n]\nNorth Carolina had around 7,800\nPatriots\njoin the\nContinental Army\nunder General\nGeorge Washington\n; and an additional 10,000 served in local militia units under such leaders as General\nNathanael Greene\n.\n[\n58\n]\nThere was some military action, especially in 1780–81. Many Carolinian frontiersmen had moved west over the mountains, into the\nWashington District\n(later known as\nTennessee\n), but in 1789, following the Revolution, the state was persuaded to relinquish its claim to the western lands. It ceded them to the national government so the\nNorthwest Territory\ncould be organized and managed nationally.\n[\n59\n]\nA major American victory\nin the war took place at\nKing's Mountain\nalong the North Carolina–South Carolina border; on October 7, 1780, a force of 1,000 Patriots from western North Carolina (including what is today the state of\nTennessee\n) and\nsouthwest Virginia\noverwhelmed a force of some 1,000 British troops led by Major\nPatrick Ferguson\n. Most of the soldiers fighting for the British side in this battle were Carolinians who had remained loyal to the Crown (they were called \"Tories\" or Loyalists). The American victory at King's Mountain gave the advantage to colonists who favored American independence, and it prevented the British Army from recruiting new soldiers from the Tories.\n[\n60\n]\n1st Maryland Regiment holding the line at the\nBattle of Guilford Court House\n, 1781\nThe road to\nYorktown\nand America's independence from\nGreat Britain\nled through North Carolina. As the\nBritish Army\nmoved north from victories in\nCharleston\nand\nCamden, South Carolina\n, the Southern Division of the\nContinental Army\nand local militia prepared to meet them. Following General\nDaniel Morgan\n's victory over the British Cavalry Commander\nBanastre Tarleton\nat the\nBattle of Cowpens\non January 17, 1781, southern commander\nNathanael Greene\nled British Lord\nCharles Cornwallis\nacross the heartland of North Carolina, and away from the latter's base of supply in Charleston, South Carolina. This campaign is known as \"The Race to the Dan\" or \"The Race for the River\".\n[\n41\n]\nIn the\nBattle of Cowan's Ford\n, Cornwallis met resistance along the banks of the\nCatawba River\nat Cowan's Ford on February 1, 1781, in an attempt to engage General Morgan's forces during a tactical withdrawal.\n[\n61\n]\nMorgan had moved to the northern part of the state to combine with General Greene's newly recruited forces. Generals Greene and Cornwallis finally met at the\nBattle of Guilford Courthouse\nin present-day\nGreensboro\non March 15, 1781. Although the\nBritish\ntroops held the field at the end of the battle, their casualties at the hands of the numerically superior Continental Army were crippling. Following this \"\nPyrrhic victory\n\", Cornwallis chose to move to the Virginia coastline to get reinforcements, and to allow the\nRoyal Navy\nto protect his battered army. This decision would result in Cornwallis' eventual defeat at\nYorktown, Virginia\n, later in 1781. The Patriots' victory there guaranteed American independence. On November 21, 1789, North Carolina became the twelfth state to ratify the\nU.S. Constitution\n.\nAntebellum period\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nConstitutional Convention (United States)\n,\nAdmission to the Union\n, and\nList of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union\nAfter 1800, cotton and tobacco became important export crops. The eastern half of the state, especially the Coastal Plain region, developed a slave society based on a\nplantation\nsystem and\nslave\nlabor. Planters owning large estates wielded significant political and socio-economic power in antebellum North Carolina. They placed their interests above those of the generally non-slave-holding\nyeoman farmers\nof North Carolina. While slaveholding was slightly less concentrated compared to some other Southern states, according to the 1860 census, more than 330,000 people, or 33% of the population out of 992,622 people in total, were enslaved African Americans.\n[\n62\n]\nThey lived and worked chiefly on plantations in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain regions of the state. In addition, 30,463\nfree people of color\nlived in the state.\n[\n62\n]\nThey were also mainly concentrated in the eastern coastal plain, especially at port cities such as Wilmington and New Bern, where a variety of jobs were available. Most were descendants from free African Americans who had migrated along with neighbors from\nVirginia\nduring the 18th century. The majority were the descendants of unions in the working classes between white women, indentured servants or free, and African men, indentured, slave or free.\n[\n63\n]\nMap of the roads and railroads of North Carolina, 1854\nAfter the American Revolution,\nQuakers\nand\nMennonites\nworked to persuade slaveholders to free their slaves. Some were inspired by their efforts and the language of the Revolution to arrange for\nmanumission\nof their slaves. The number of free people of color rose markedly in the first couple of decades after the Revolution.\n[\n64\n]\nMany\nfree people of color\nmigrated to the frontier, along with their European-American neighbors, where the social system was looser. By 1810, nearly three percent of the free population consisted of free people of color, who numbered slightly more than 10,000. The western areas of North Carolina were mainly white families of\nEuropean\ndescent, especially\nScotch-Irish\n, who operated small subsistence farms. In the early national period, the state became a center of\nJeffersonian\nand\nJacksonian democracy\n, with a strong\nWhig\npresence, especially in the western part of the state. After\nNat Turner\n's slave uprising in 1831, North Carolina and other southern states reduced the rights of free blacks. In 1835, the legislature withdrew their right to vote.\nIn mid-century, the state's rural and commercial areas were connected by the construction of a 129 mi (208 km) wooden plank road, known as a \"farmer's railroad\", from\nFayetteville\nin the east to\nBethania\n(northwest of\nWinston-Salem\n).\n[\n41\n]\nOn October 25, 1836, construction began on the\nWilmington and Raleigh Railroad\n[\n65\n]\nto connect the port city of\nWilmington\nwith the state capital of\nRaleigh\n. In 1840, the\nstate capitol\nbuilding in Raleigh was completed, and still stands today.\nIn 1849, the North Carolina Railroad was created by act of the legislature to extend that railroad west to\nGreensboro\n,\nHigh Point\n, and\nCharlotte\n. During the Civil War, the Wilmington-to-Raleigh stretch of the railroad was vital to the Confederate war effort; supplies shipped into Wilmington were moved by rail through Raleigh to the Confederate capital of\nRichmond, Virginia\n.\n[\n66\n]\nAmerican Civil War\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nOrdinance of Secession\n,\nConfederate States of America\n, and\nNorth Carolina in the American Civil War\nFurther information:\nAmerican Civil War\nUnion troops capture\nFort Fisher\n, 1865\nIn 1860, North Carolina was a slave state, in which one-third of the state's total population were African-American slaves. The state did not vote to join the\nConfederacy\nuntil President\nAbraham Lincoln\ncalled on it to invade its sister state,\n[\n67\n]\nSouth Carolina\n, becoming the last or penultimate state to officially join the Confederacy. The title of \"last to join the Confederacy\" has been disputed; although Tennessee's informal secession on May 7, 1861, preceded North Carolina's official secession on May 20,\n[\n68\n]\n[\n69\n]\nthe Tennessee legislature did not formally vote to secede until June 8, 1861.\n[\n70\n]\nAround 125,000 troops from North Carolina served in the Confederate Army, and about 15,000 North Carolina troops (both black and white) served in\nUnion Army regiments\n, including those who left the state to join Union regiments elsewhere.\n[\n71\n]\nOver 30,000 North Carolina troops died from combat or disease during the war.\n[\n72\n]\nElected in 1862, Governor\nZebulon Baird Vance\ntried to maintain state autonomy against Confederate President\nJefferson Davis\nin\nRichmond\n. The state government was reluctant to support the demands of the national government in\nRichmond\n, and the state was the scene of only small battles. In 1865, Durham County saw the largest single surrender of Confederate soldiers at\nBennett Place\n, when\nJoseph E. Johnston\nsurrendered the Army of Tennessee and all remaining Confederate forces still active in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, totalling 89,270 soldiers.\n[\n73\n]\nBennett Place\nhistoric site in\nDurham\nConfederate troops from all parts of North Carolina served in virtually all the major battles of the\nArmy of Northern Virginia\n, the Confederacy's most famous army. The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at\nBentonville\n, which was a futile attempt by Confederate General\nJoseph Johnston\nto slow Union General\nWilliam Tecumseh Sherman\n's advance through the Carolinas in the spring of 1865.\n[\n41\n]\nIn April 1865, after losing the\nBattle of Morrisville\n, Johnston surrendered to Sherman at\nBennett Place\n, in what is today\nDurham\n. North Carolina's port city of\nWilmington\n, was the last Confederate port to fall to the Union, in February 1865, after the Union won the nearby\nSecond Battle of Fort Fisher\n, its major defense downriver.\nThe first Confederate soldier to be killed in the Civil War was Private\nHenry Wyatt\nfrom North Carolina, in the\nBattle of Big Bethel\nin June 1861. At the\nBattle of Gettysburg\nin July 1863, the 26th North Carolina Regiment participated in\nPickett/Pettigrew's Charge\nand advanced the farthest into Union lines of any Confederate regiment. During the\nBattle of Chickamauga\n, the 58th North Carolina Regiment advanced farther than any other regiment on Snodgrass Hill to push back the remaining Union forces from the battlefield. At\nAppomattox Court House\nin Virginia in April 1865, the 75th North Carolina Regiment, a cavalry unit, fired the last shots of the Confederate\nArmy of Northern Virginia\nin the Civil War.  The phrase \"First at Bethel, Farthest at Gettysburg and Chickamauga, and Last at Appomattox\", later became used through much of the early 20th century.\n[\n74\n]\nAfter secession, some North Carolinians refused to support the Confederacy. Some of the yeoman farmers chiefly in the state's mountains and western Piedmont region remained neutral during the Civil War, with others covertly supporting the\nUnion\ncause during the conflict.\n[\n75\n]\nApproximately\n15,000 North Carolinians\n(both black and white) from across the state enlisted in the\nUnion Army\n.

To earn back its rights, the state had to make concessions to Washington, one of which was ratifying the\nThirteenth Amendment\n. Congressional Republicans during Reconstruction, commonly referred to as \"\nradical Republicans\n\", constantly pushed for new constitutions for each of the Southern states that emphasized equal rights for African-Americans. In 1868, a constitutional convention restored the state government of North Carolina. Though the\nFifteenth Amendment\nwas also adopted that same year, it remained\nin most cases\nineffective for almost a century, not to mention paramilitary groups and their\nlynching\nwith impunity.\n[\n76\n]\nThe elections in April 1868 following the constitutional convention led to a narrow victory for a Republican-dominated government, with 19 African-Americans holding positions in the\nNorth Carolina State Legislature\n.

Republicans were elected to the governorship until 1876, when the\nRed Shirts\n, a paramilitary organization that arose in 1874 and was allied with the\nDemocratic Party\n, helped suppress black voting. More than 150 black Americans were murdered in electoral violence in 1876.\n[\n77\n]\n[\n78\n]\nPost–Civil War-debt cycles pushed people to switch from subsistence agriculture to commodity agriculture. Among this time the notorious Crop-Lien system developed and was financially difficult on landless whites and blacks, due to high amounts of usury. Also due to the push for commodity agriculture, the free range was ended. Prior to this time people fenced in their crops and had their livestock feeding on the free range areas. After the ending of the free range people now fenced their animals and had their crops in the open.\n[\n79\n]\n[\n80\n]\nSegregated drinking fountain during the\nJim Crow\nera in\nHalifax\n, 1938\nDemocrats were elected to the legislature and governor's office, but the\nPopulists\nattracted voters displeased with them.

Formed near Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill, the\nResearch Triangle\nmetro is a major area of universities and advanced scientific and technical research. By holding a 1956 meeting which helped lead to the creation of the park, Governor\nLuther H. Hodges\nlaunched the transformation of his state from one of the poorest in the Union to one of the most prosperous.\n[\n85\n]\nIn contrast, South Carolina's leaders lacked such vision, explaining why that state was and still is among the poorest in the country.\n[\n85\n]\nThe\nGreensboro sit-ins\nin 1960 played a crucial role in the Civil Rights Movement to bring full equality to American blacks. By the late 1960s, spurred in part by the increasingly leftward tilt of national Democrats, conservative whites began to vote for Republican national candidates and gradually for more Republicans locally.\n[\n86\n]\n[\n87\n]\nLate 20th century to present\n[\nedit\n]\nNorth Carolina Museum of History\nin Raleigh, 2008\nSince the 1970s, North Carolina has seen steady increases in population growth. This growth has largely occurred in\nmetropolitan areas\nlocated within the\nPiedmont Crescent\n, in places such as Charlotte, Concord, Greensboro, Winston-Salem, Durham and Raleigh.\n[\n88\n]\nThe Charlotte metropolitan area has experienced large growth mainly due to its finance, banking, and tech industries.\n[\n89\n]\nBy the 1990s, Charlotte had become a major regional and national banking center. Towards Raleigh,\nNorth Carolina State\n,\nDuke University\n, and\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n, have helped the\nResearch Triangle\narea attract an educated workforce and develop more jobs.\n[\n90\n]\nIn 1988, North Carolina gained its first professional sports franchise, the\nCharlotte Hornets\nof the\nNational Basketball Association\n(NBA). The hornets team name stems from the\nAmerican Revolutionary War\n, when British General Cornwallis described Charlotte as a \"hornet's nest of rebellion\".\n[\n91\n]\nThe\nCarolina Panthers\nof the\nNational Football League\n(NFL) became based in Charlotte as well, with their first season being in 1995. The\nCarolina Hurricanes\nof the\nNational Hockey League\n(NHL) moved to\nRaleigh\nin 1997, with their colors being the same as the\nNC State Wolfpack\n, who are also located in Raleigh.\nBy the late 20th century and into the early 21st century, economic industries such as technology,\npharmaceuticals\n, banking,\nfood processing\n,\nvehicle parts\n, and tourism started to emerge as North Carolina's main economic drivers. This marked a shift from the state's former main industries of\ntobacco\n,\ntextiles\n, and furniture. Factors that played a role in this shift were globalization, the state's higher education system, national banking, the transformation of agriculture, and new companies moving to the state.\n[\n92\n]\nGeography\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nGeography of North Carolina\nInteractive map of North Carolina\n3D Topographical Map of North Carolina\nDeer in the\nEno River\nas it flows through the Piedmont region of North Carolina\nKöppen climate types of North Carolina\nNorth Carolina is bordered by\nSouth Carolina\non the south,\nGeorgia\non the southwest,\nTennessee\non the west,\nVirginia\non the north, and the Atlantic Ocean on the east. The\nUnited States Census Bureau\nplaces North Carolina in the\nSouth Atlantic\ndivision of the\nsouthern\nregion.\n[\n93\n]\nIt has a total area of 53,819.16 square miles (139,391.0 km\n2\n), of which 48,617.91 square miles (125,919.8 km\n2\n) is land and 5,201.25 square miles (13,471.2 km\n2\n) (9.66%) is water.\n[\n94\n]\nNorth Carolina consists of three main geographic regions: the\nAtlantic coastal plain\n, occupying the eastern portion of the state; the central\nPiedmont\nregion, and the mountain region in the west, which is part of the\nAppalachian Mountains\n. The coastal plain consists of more specifically defined areas known as the\nOuter Banks\n, a string of sandy, narrow\nbarrier islands\nseparated from the mainland by sounds or inlets, including\nAlbemarle Sound\nand\nPamlico Sound\n, the native home of the\nvenus flytrap\n, and the inner coastal plain, where\nlongleaf pine\ntrees are native.\nSo many ships have been lost off\nCape Hatteras\nthat the area is known as the \"\nGraveyard of the Atlantic\n\"; more than a thousand ships have sunk in these waters since records began in 1526. The most famous of these is the\nQueen Anne's Revenge\n(flagship of the pirate\nBlackbeard\n), which went aground in Beaufort Inlet in 1718.\n[\n95\n]\nThe coastal plain transitions to the Piedmont region along the\nAtlantic Seaboard fall line\n, the elevation at which waterfalls first appear on streams and rivers. The Piedmont region of central North Carolina is the state's most populous region, containing the six largest cities in the state by population.\n[\n96\n]\nIt consists of gently rolling countryside frequently broken by hills or low mountain ridges. Small, isolated, and deeply eroded mountain ranges and peaks are located in the Piedmont, including the\nSauratown Mountains\n,\nPilot Mountain\n, the\nUwharrie Mountains\n,\nCrowder's Mountain\n,\nKing's Pinnacle\n, the\nBrushy Mountains\n, and the\nSouth Mountains\n. The Piedmont ranges from about 300 feet (100 m) in elevation in the east to about 1,500 feet (500 m) in the west.\nThe\nwestern section\nof the state is part of the\nBlue Ridge Mountains\nof the larger\nAppalachian Mountain\nrange. Among the subranges of the Blue Ridge Mountains located in the state are the\nGreat Smoky Mountains\nand the\nBlack Mountains\n.\n[\n97\n]\n[\n98\n]\nThe Black Mountains are the highest in the eastern United States, and culminate in\nMount Mitchell\nat 6,684 feet (2,037 m), the highest point east of the\nMississippi River\n.\n[\n98\n]\n[\n99\n]\nCullasaja Falls\nin\nMacon County\nNorth Carolina has 17 major river basins. The five basins west of the\nBlue Ridge Mountains\nflow to the\nGulf of Mexico\n, while the remainder flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n[\n100\n]\nOf the 17 basins, 11 originate within the state of North Carolina, but only four are contained entirely within the state's border—the\nCape Fear\n, the\nNeuse\n, the\nWhite Oak\n, and the\nTar\n–\nPamlico\nbasin.\n[\n101\n]\nFlora and fauna\n[\nedit\n]\nFurther information:\nWildlife of North Carolina\nMajor rivers\n[\nedit\n]\nFurther information:\nList of rivers of North Carolina\nClimate\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nClimate of North Carolina\nSee also:\nClimate change in North Carolina\nGraveyard Fields\nin the fall\nElevation above sea level is most responsible for temperature change across the state, with the mountainous regions being coolest year-round. The climate is also influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and the\nGulf Stream\n, especially in the coastal plain. These influences tend to cause warmer winter temperatures along the coast, where temperatures only occasionally drop below the freezing point at night. The coastal plain averages around 1 inch (2.5 cm) of snow or ice annually, and in many years, there may be no snow or ice at all.\n[\n102\n]\nThe Atlantic Ocean exerts less influence on the climate of the Piedmont region, which has hotter summers and colder winters than along the coast, though winters are still mild.\n[\n102\n]\nNorth Carolina experiences severe weather both in summer and in winter, with summer bringing threat of\nhurricanes\n,\ntropical storms\n, heavy rain, and flooding.\n[\n103\n]\nDestructive hurricanes that have hit North Carolina include\nHurricane Fran\n,\nHurricane Florence\n,\nHurricane Floyd\n,\nHurricane Hugo\n, and\nHurricane Hazel\n, the latter being the strongest storm ever to make landfall in the state, as a\nCategory\n4\nin 1954.\nHurricane Helene\nranks as the most destructive of the 21st century.\n[\n104\n]\n[\n105\n]\nNorth Carolina averages fewer than 20 tornadoes per year, many of them produced by hurricanes or tropical storms along the coastal plain. Tornadoes from thunderstorms are a risk, especially in the eastern part of the state. The western Piedmont is often protected by the mountains, which tend to break up storms as they cross over; the storms will often re-form farther east. A phenomenon known as \"\ncold-air damming\n\" often occurs in the northwestern part of the state, which can weaken storms but can also lead to major ice events in winter.\n[\n106\n]\nIn April 2011,\nthe worst tornado outbreak\nin North Carolina's history occurred. Thirty confirmed tornadoes touched down, mainly in the Eastern Piedmont and Sandhills, killing at least 24 people.\n[\n107\n]\n[\n108\n]\nIn September 2019\nHurricane Dorian\nhit the area.\nMonthly normal high and low temperatures (\nFahrenheit\n) for various North Carolina cities.\nCity\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec\nAsheville\n[\n109\n]\n47/27\n51/30\n59/35\n68/43\n75/51\n81/60\n84/64\n83/63\n77/56\n68/45\n59/36\n49/29\nBoone\n[\n110\n]\n42/21\n45/23\n52/29\n61/37\n69/46\n76/54\n79/58\n78/57\n72/50\n63/39\n54/31\n45/24\nCape Hatteras\n[\n111\n]\n52/39\n54/40\n59/45\n66/53\n74/61\n81/69\n85/74\n84/73\n80/69\n72/60\n64/51\n56/43\nCharlotte\n[\n109\n]\n51/30\n55/33\n63/39\n72/47\n79/56\n86/64\n89/68\n88/67\n81/60\n72/49\n62/39\n53/32\nFayetteville\n[\n112\n]\n54/33\n59/35\n66/42\n75/50\n82/59\n89/68\n91/72\n90/70\n84/64\n75/52\n67/43\n56/35\nGreensboro\n[\n112\n]\n48/30\n53/32\n61/39\n70/47\n78/56\n85/65\n88/69\n86/68\n80/61\n70/49\n61/40\n51/32\nRaleigh\n[\n112\n]\n51/31\n55/34\n63/40\n72/48\n80/57\n87/66\n90/70\n88/69\n82/62\n73/50\n64/41\n54/33\nWilmington\n[\n113\n]\n56/36\n60/38\n66/44\n74/52\n81/60\n87/69\n90/73\n88/71\n84/66\n76/55\n68/45\n59/38\nClimate data for North Carolina\nMonth\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec\nYear\nRecord high °F (°C)\n86\n(30)\n90\n(32)\n100\n(38)\n102\n(39)\n107\n(42)\n108\n(42)\n109\n(43)\n110\n(43)\n109\n(43)\n102\n(39)\n90\n(32)\n87\n(31)\n110\n(43)\nMean daily maximum °F (°C)\n49.9\n(9.9)\n53.7\n(12.1)\n61.8\n(16.6)\n71.0\n(21.7)\n78.1\n(25.6)\n85.2\n(29.6)\n88.1\n(31.2)\n86.8\n(30.4)\n80.8\n(27.1)\n71.6\n(22.0)\n62.5\n(16.9)\n52.5\n(11.4)\n70.2\n(21.2)\nDaily mean °F (°C)\n39.2\n(4.0)\n42.3\n(5.7)\n49.5\n(9.7)\n58.1\n(14.5)\n66.1\n(18.9)\n74.1\n(23.4)\n77.5\n(25.3)\n76.3\n(24.6)\n69.9\n(21.1)\n59.4\n(15.2)\n50.4\n(10.2)\n41.7\n(5.4)\n58.7\n(14.8)\nMean daily minimum °F (°C)\n28.4\n(−2.0)\n30.9\n(−0.6)\n37.2\n(2.9)\n45.2\n(7.3)\n54.0\n(12.2)\n63.0\n(17.2)\n66.8\n(19.3)\n65.8\n(18.8)\n58.9\n(14.9)\n47.2\n(8.4)\n38.3\n(3.5)\n30.8\n(−0.7)\n47.2\n(8.4)\nRecord low °F (°C)\n−34\n(−37)\n−31\n(−35)\n−29\n(−34)\n0\n(−18)\n13\n(−11)\n22\n(−6)\n30\n(−1)\n29\n(−2)\n23\n(−5)\n5\n(−15)\n−22\n(−30)\n−33\n(−36)\n−34\n(−37)\nAverage\nprecipitation\ninches (mm)\n3.7\n(94)\n3.5\n(89)\n4.2\n(110)\n3.5\n(89)\n3.8\n(97)\n4.3\n(110)\n4.8\n(120)\n4.7\n(120)\n4.3\n(110)\n3.3\n(84)\n3.3\n(84)\n3.5\n(89)\n46.9\n(1,196)\nAverage snowfall inches (cm)\n2.0\n(5.1)\n1.4\n(3.6)\n0.6\n(1.5)\n0.1\n(0.25)\n0.0\n(0.0)\n0.0\n(0.0)\n0.0\n(0.0)\n0.0\n(0.0)\n0.0\n(0.0)\n0.0\n(0.0)\n0.1\n(0.25)\n0.8\n(2.0)\n5\n(12.7)\nSource 1: USA.com (averages)\n[\n114\n]\nSource 2: North Carolina State Climate Office (extremes)\n[\n115\n]\nParks and recreation\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nBlue Ridge Mountains\nof the\nShining Rock Wilderness Area\nNorth Carolina provides a large range of recreational activities, from swimming at the beach to\nskiing\nin the mountains.

These consist of the\nCouncil of State\n(led by the\nGovernor\n), the\nbicameral\nlegislature (called the\nGeneral Assembly\n), and the state court system (headed by the\nNorth Carolina Supreme Court\n). The\nstate constitution\ndelineates the structure and function of the state government. Most municipalities in North Carolina operate under\ncouncil–manager governments\n.\n[\n233\n]\nNorth Carolina's party loyalties have undergone a series of important shifts in the last few years: While the 2010 midterms saw\nTarheel\nvoters elect a bicameral\nRepublican\nmajority legislature for the first time in more than a century, North Carolina has also become a Southern\nswing state\nin presidential races. Since Southern Democrat\nJimmy Carter\n's comfortable victory in the state\nin 1976\n, the state had consistently leaned Republican in presidential elections until Democrat\nBarack Obama\nnarrowly won the state\nin 2008\n. In the 1990s, Democrat\nBill Clinton\ncame within a point of winning the state\nin 1992\nand also only narrowly lost the state\nin 1996\n. In\n2000\n, Republican\nGeorge W. Bush\neasily won the state by more than 13 points.\nBy\n2008\n, demographic shifts, population growth, and increased liberalization in densely populated areas such as the\nResearch Triangle\n,\nCharlotte\n,\nGreensboro\n,\nWinston-Salem\n,\nFayetteville\n, and\nAsheville\n, propelled Barack Obama to victory in North Carolina, the first Democrat to win the state since 1976. In\n2012\n, North Carolina was again considered a competitive swing state, with the Democrats even holding their\n2012 Democratic National Convention\nin Charlotte. However, Republican\nMitt Romney\nultimately eked out a two-point win in North Carolina, the only 2012 swing state Obama lost, and one of only two states (along with\nIndiana\n) to flip from Obama in 2008 to the GOP in 2012. Furthermore, Republican Donald Trump carried the state in\n2016\n,\n2020\n, and\n2024\n.\n2024 U.S. presidential election results\nby county in North Carolina, shaded by relative margin of victory (MOV)\nDemocratic\nRepublican\nIn 2012, the state elected a Republican governor (\nPat McCrory\n) and lieutenant governor (\nDan Forest\n) for the first time in more than two decades, while also giving the Republicans veto-proof majorities in both the State House of Representatives and the State Senate. Several U.S. House of Representatives seats flipped control in 2012, with the Republicans holding nine seats to the Democrats' four. In the\n2014 midterm\nelections, Republican\nDavid Rouzer\nwon the state's\n7th congressional district\nseat, increasing the congressional delegation party split to 10–3 in favor of the GOP, a split they retained in subsequent elections until 2020, when it narrowed to 8–5 in favor of the GOP. In 2016, despite Donald Trump winning the state, North Carolina voters elected Democrat Roy Cooper as governor, in part due to an unpopular law passed by former governor Pat McCrory known as\nHB2\n. Cooper went on to win re-election in 2020, despite Donald Trump narrowly winning the state again against Joe Biden.\nAs a result of the 2020 census, North Carolina gained another seat in the\n118th United States Congress\n, for a total of 14.\n[\n234\n]\nAfter the 2024 elections, the state was represented by 10 Republicans and 4 Democrats.\nIn a 2020 study, North Carolina was ranked as the 23rd easiest state for citizens to vote in.\n[\n235\n]\nGerrymandering\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nGerrymandering in the United States\nand\nNorth Carolina's congressional districts\nThe state has been sued for\nracially gerrymandering\nthe districts, which resulted in minority voting power being diluted in some areas, resulting in skewed representation. In 2000, the\nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina\nruled that the\n12th congressional district\nwas an illegal racial gerrymander.\n[\n236\n]\nThis was again appealed, now as\nEasley v. Cromartie\n. The\nU.S. Supreme Court\nreversed the Eastern District of North Carolina in 2001 and ruled that the 12th district boundaries were not racially based but was a\npartisan gerrymander\n. They said this was a political question that the courts should not rule upon.\n[\n237\n]\nIn 2015, federal courts again ordered redistricting.\n[\n238\n]\nTwo lawsuits challenging the state congressional district map were led by \"two dozen voters, the state Democratic Party, the state chapter of the League of Women Voters, and the interest group Common Cause\".\n[\n238\n]\nThey contend that the redistricting resulted in deliberate under-representation of a substantial portion of voters. This case reached the U.S. Supreme Court in March 2019, which also heard a related partisan gerrymandering case from Maryland.\n[\n238\n]\nOn February 4, 2022, the North Carolina Supreme Court struck down the congressional and state legislative district maps drawn by the GOP-controlled\nGeneral Assembly\non terms of partisan gerrymandering in a 4–3 ruling.\n[\n239\n]\nLater that month, a panel of three former judges chosen by the Wake County Superior Court drew and approved a remedial congressional map after the new map proposed by the General Assembly was struck down by the North Carolina Supreme Court. Though, the state legislative maps proposed by the General Assembly were allowed to be used. The General Assembly would then redraw all three maps for the\n2024 elections\nin the state.\n[\n240\n]\n[\n241\n]\nOn April 28, 2023, the North Carolina Supreme Court—after Republicans gained a majority in the court following the\n2022 judicial elections\n—overturned the same ruling in a 5–2 decision, which cleared the way for gerrymandering in the next redistricting cycle.\n[\n242\n]\n[\n243\n]\nNew maps were approved by the General Assembly on October 25, 2023.

For other uses, see\nSchooling (disambiguation)\n.\nFirst\nprimary school\nin\nNigeria\n, built in 1845\n[\n1\n]\nA\nhigh school\nbuilding in\nArgos, Greece\nA\nschool\nis an\neducational institution\n(and, in the case of in-person learning, the\nbuilding\n) designed to provide\nlearning environments\nfor the\nteaching\nof\nstudents\n, usually under the direction of\nteachers\n. Most countries have systems of formal\neducation\n, which is sometimes\ncompulsory\n.\n[\n2\n]\nIn these systems, students progress through a series of schools that can be built and operated by both government and private organizations. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the\nRegional terms\nsection below) but generally include\nprimary school\nfor young children and\nsecondary school\nfor teenagers who have completed\nprimary education\n. An institution where\nhigher education\nis taught is commonly called a\nuniversity college\nor\nuniversity\n.\nIn addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary (elementary in the U.S.) and secondary (middle school in the U.S.) education.\n[\n3\n]\nKindergarten\nor\npreschool\nprovide some schooling to very young children (typically ages 3–5). University,\nvocational school\n,\ncollege\n, or\nseminary\nmay be available after secondary school. A school may be dedicated to one particular field, such as a school of economics or dance.\nAlternative schools\nmay provide nontraditional curriculum and methods.\nNon-government schools, also known as\nprivate schools\n,\n[\n4\n]\nmay be required when the government does not supply adequate or specific educational needs. Other private schools can also be religious, such as\nChristian schools\n,\ngurukula\n(Hindu schools),\nmadrasa\n(Arabic schools),\nhawzas\n(Shi'i Muslim schools),\nyeshivas\n(Jewish schools), and others; or schools that have a higher standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements. Schools for adults include institutions of\ncorporate training\n,\nmilitary education and training\n, and\nbusiness schools\n.\nCritics of school\noften accuse the school system of failing to adequately prepare students for their future lives,\n[\n5\n]\nof encouraging certain temperaments while inhibiting others,\n[\n6\n]\nof prescribing students exactly what to do, how, when, where and with whom, which would suppress\ncreativity\n,\n[\n7\n]\nand of using\nextrinsic\nmeasures such as\ngrades\nand\nhomework\n, which would inhibit children's natural\ncuriosity\nand desire to learn.\n[\n8\n]\nIn\nhomeschooling\nand\ndistance education\n, teaching and learning take place independent from the institution of school or in a\nvirtual school\noutside a traditional school building, respectively. Schools are organized in several different\norganizational models\n, including departmental, small learning communities, academies, integrated, and schools-within-a-school.\nEtymology\nThe word\nschool\nderives from\nGreek\nσχολή\n(\nscholē\n), originally meaning \"leisure\" and also \"that in which leisure is employed\", but later \"a group to whom lectures were given, school\".\n[\n9\n]\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\nHistory and development\nSee also:\nHistory of education\nPlato\n's academy,\nmosaic from Pompeii\nThe concept of grouping students together in a centralized location for learning has existed since\nClassical antiquity\n. Formal schools have existed at least since\nancient Greece\n(see\nAcademy\n),\nancient Rome\n(see\nEducation in Ancient Rome\n)\nancient India\n(see\nGurukul\n), and\nancient China\n(see\nHistory of education in China\n). The\nByzantine Empire\nhad an established schooling system beginning at the primary level. According to\nTraditions and Encounters\n, the founding of the primary education system began in 425 AD and \"...\nmilitary personnel\nusually had at least a primary education ...\". The sometimes efficient and often large government of the Empire meant that educated citizens were a must. Although Byzantium lost much of the grandeur of Roman culture and extravagance in the process of surviving, the Empire emphasized efficiency in its war manuals. The Byzantine education system continued until the empire's collapse in 1453 AD.\n[\n12\n]\nIn Western Europe, a considerable number of\ncathedral schools\nwere founded during the\nEarly Middle Ages\nin order to teach future clergy and administrators, with the oldest still existing, and continuously operated, cathedral schools being\nThe King's School, Canterbury\n(established 597 CE),\nKing's School, Rochester\n(established 604 CE),\nSt Peter's School, York\n(established 627 CE) and\nThetford Grammar School\n(established 631 CE). Beginning in the 5th century CE,\nmonastic schools\nwere also established throughout Western Europe, teaching religious and secular subjects.\nMental calculations. In the school of S. Rachinsky by\nNikolay Bogdanov-Belsky\n. Russia, 1895.\nIn Europe, universities emerged during the 12th century; here,\nscholasticism\nwas an important tool, and the academicians were called\nschoolmen\n. During the\nMiddle Ages\nand much of the\nEarly Modern\nperiod, the main purpose of schools (as opposed to universities) was to teach the\nLatin language\n. This led to the term\ngrammar school\n, which in the United States informally refers to a primary school, but in the United Kingdom means a school that selects entrants based on ability or aptitude. The school curriculum has gradually broadened to include literacy in the vernacular language and technical, artistic, scientific, and practical subjects.\nObligatory school attendance became common in parts of Europe during the 18th century. In\nDenmark-Norway\n, this was introduced as early as in 1739–1741, the primary end being to increase the literacy of the\nalmue\n, i.e., the \"regular people\".\n[\n13\n]\nMany of the earlier public schools in the United States and elsewhere were\none-room schools\nwhere a single teacher taught seven grades of boys and girls in the same classroom. Beginning in the 1920s, one-room schools were consolidated into multiple classroom facilities with transportation increasingly provided by\nkid hacks\nand\nschool buses\n.\nIslam\nwas another culture that developed a school system in the modern sense of the word. Emphasis was put on knowledge, which required a systematic way of teaching and spreading knowledge and purpose-built structures. At first,\nmosques\ncombined religious performance and learning activities. However, by the 9th century, the\nmadrassa\nwas introduced, a school that was built independently from the mosque, such as\nal-Qarawiyyin\n, founded in 859 CE. They were also the first to make the\nMadrassa\nsystem a public domain under\nCaliph\n's control.\nUnder the\nOttomans\n, the towns of\nBursa\nand\nEdirne\nbecame the main centers of learning. The Ottoman system of\nKülliye\n, a building complex containing a mosque, a hospital, madrassa, and public kitchen and dining areas, revolutionized the education system, making learning accessible to a broader public through its free meals, health care, and sometimes free accommodation.\nRegional terms\nThe term \"\nschool\"\nvaries by country, as do the names of the various levels of education within the country.\nUnited Kingdom and Commonwealth of Nations\nIn the United Kingdom, the term\nschool\nrefers primarily to pre-\nuniversity\ninstitutions, and these can, for the most part, be divided into\npre-schools\nor\nnursery schools\n,\nprimary schools\n(sometimes further divided into\ninfant school\nand\njunior school\n), and\nsecondary schools\n. Various types of secondary schools in England and Wales include\ngrammar schools\n,\ncomprehensives\n,\nsecondary moderns\n, and\ncity academies\n.\n[\n14\n]\nWhile they may have different names in Scotland, there is only one type of secondary school. However, they may be funded either by the state or independently funded. Scotland's school performance is monitored by\nEducation Scotland\n.\nOfsted\nreports on performance in England and\nEstyn\nreports on performance in Wales.\nIn the United Kingdom, most schools are publicly funded and known as\nstate schools\nor maintained schools in which tuition is provided for free.\n[\n15\n]\nThere are also private schools or\nprivate schools\nthat charge fees. Some of the most selective and expensive private schools are known as\npublic schools\n, a usage that can be confusing to speakers of\nNorth American English\n. In North American usage, a\npublic school\nis publicly funded or run.\nIn much of the\nCommonwealth of Nations\n, including Australia, New Zealand, India,\nPakistan\n, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania, the term\nschool\nrefers primarily to pre-university institutions.\n[\n16\n]\nIndia\nLoyola School, Chennai, India – run by the\nCatholic Diocese of Madras\n. Christian missionaries played a pivotal role in establishing modern schools in India.\nIn ancient India, schools were in the form of\nGurukuls\n. Gurukuls were traditional\nHindu\nresidential learning schools, typically the teacher's house or a monastery. Schools today are commonly known by the Sanskrit terms\nVidyashram\n,\nVidyalayam\n,\nVidya\nMandir\n,\nVidya Bhavan\nin India.\n[\n17\n]\nIn\nsouthern\nlanguages, it is known as\nPallikoodam\nor\nPaadaSaalai\n. During the Mughal rule,\nMadrasahs\nwere introduced in India to educate the children of Muslim parents. British records show that indigenous education was widespread in the 18th century, with a school for every temple, mosque, or village in most regions. The subjects taught included Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Theology, Law, Astronomy, Metaphysics, Ethics, Medical Science, and Religion.\n[\n18\n]\nA school building in\nKannur\n, India\nUnder British rule, Christian missionaries from England, the United States, and other countries established missionary and boarding schools in India.\n[\n19\n]\nLater as these schools gained popularity, more were started, and some gained prestige. These schools marked the beginning of modern schooling in India. The syllabus and calendar they followed became the benchmark for schools in modern India. Today most schools follow the\nmissionary school\nmodel for tutoring, subject/syllabus, and governance, with minor changes.\n[\n20\n]\nSchools in India range from large campuses with thousands of students and hefty fees to schools where children are taught under a tree with a small / no campus and are free of cost. There are various boards of schools in India, namely\nCentral Board for Secondary Education\n(CBSE), Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), Madrasa Boards of various states, Matriculation Boards of various states, State Boards of various boards, Anglo Indian Board, among others. Today's typical syllabus includes language(s), mathematics, science – physics, chemistry, biology, geography, history, general knowledge, and information technology/computer science. Extracurricular activities include physical education/sports and cultural activities like music, choreography, painting, and theatre/drama.\n[\n21\n]\nEurope\nAlbert Bettannier\n's 1887 painting\nLa Tache noire\ndepicts a child being taught about the \"lost\" province of\nAlsace-Lorraine\nin the aftermath of the\nFranco-Prussian War\n– an example of how European schools were often used in order to inoculate\nNationalism\nin their pupils.\nIn much of continental Europe, the term\nschool\nusually applies to\nprimary education\n, with primary schools that last between four and nine years, depending on the country. It also applies to\nsecondary education\n, with secondary schools often divided between\nGymnasiums\nand\nvocational schools\n, which again, depending on country and type of school, educate students for between three and six years. In Germany, students graduating from Grundschule are not allowed to progress into a vocational school directly. Instead, they are supposed to proceed to one of Germany's general education schools such as\nGesamtschule\n,\nHauptschule\n,\nRealschule\nor\nGymnasium\n.\n[\n22\n]\nWhen they leave that school, which usually happens at age 15–19, they may proceed to a vocational school. The term school is rarely used for\ntertiary education\n, except for some\nupper\nor\nhigh\nschools (German: Hochschule), which describe colleges and universities.\n[\n22\n]\nIn\nEastern Europe\nmodern schools (after\nWorld War II\n), of both primary and secondary educations, often are combined. In contrast, secondary education might be split into accomplished or not. The schools are classified as middle schools of general education. For the technical purposes, they include \"degrees\" of the education they provide out of three available: the first – primary, the second – unaccomplished secondary, and the third – accomplished secondary. Usually, the first two degrees of education (eight years) are always included. In contrast, the last one (two years) permits the students to pursue\nvocational\nor specialized educations.\nNorth America and the United States\nOne-room school in 1935,\nAlabama\nIn North America, the term\nschool\ncan refer to any educational institution at any level and covers all of the following:\npreschool\n(for\ntoddlers\n),\nkindergarten\n,\nelementary school\n,\nmiddle school\n(also called intermediate school or junior high school, depending on specific age groups and geographic region), high school (or in some cases senior high school), college, university, and\ngraduate school\n.\n[\n23\n]\nIn the United States, school performance through high school is monitored by each state's\ndepartment of education\n.\nCharter schools\nare publicly funded elementary or secondary schools that have been freed from some of the rules, regulations, and statutes that apply to other public schools. The terms\ngrammar school\nand\ngrade school\nare sometimes used to refer to a primary school due to British colonial legacies.\n[\n24\n]\nIn addition, there are tax-funded\nmagnet schools\nwhich offer different programs and instruction not available in traditional schools.\nAfrica\nIn West Africa, \"school\" can also refer to \"bush\" schools, Quranic schools, or apprenticeships. These schools include formal and informal learning.\nBush schools are training camps that pass down cultural skills, traditions, and knowledge to their students. Bush schools are semi-similar to traditional western schools because they are separated from the larger community. These schools are located in forests outside of the towns and villages, and the space used is solely for these schools. Once the students have arrived in the forest, they cannot leave until their training is complete. Visitors are prohibited from these areas.\n[\n25\n]\nInstead of being separated by age, Bush schools are separated by gender. Women and girls cannot enter the boys' bush school territory and vice versa. Boys receive training in cultural crafts, fighting, hunting, and community laws among other subjects.\n[\n25\n]\nGirls are trained in their own version of the boys' bush school. They practice domestic affairs such as cooking, childcare, and being a good wife. Their training is focused on how to be a proper woman by societal standards.\nA\nmadrasah\nin the Gambia\nQur'anic schools are the principal way of teaching the Quran and knowledge of the Islamic faith. These schools also fostered literacy and writing during the time of colonization. Today, the emphasis is on the different levels of reading, memorizing, and reciting the Quran. Attending a Qur'anic school is how children become recognized members of the Islamic faith. Children often attend state schools and a Qur'anic school.\nIn Mozambique, specifically, there are two kinds of Qur'anic schools. They are the tariqa based and the Wahhabi-based schools. What makes these schools different is who controls them. Tariqa schools are controlled at the local level. In contrast, the Wahhabi are controlled by the Islamic Council.\n[\n26\n]\nWithin the Qur'anic school system, there are levels of education. They range from a basic level of understanding, called chuo and kioni in local languages, to the most advanced, which is called ilimu.\n[\n27\n]\nIn Nigeria, the term\nschool\nbroadly covers\ndaycares\n,\nnursery schools\n,\nprimary schools\n,\nsecondary schools\nand\ntertiary institutions\n. Primary and secondary schools are either privately funded by religious institutions and corporate organisations or government-funded. Government-funded schools are commonly referred to as public schools. Students spend six years in primary school, three years in junior secondary school, and three years in senior secondary school. The first nine years of formal schooling is compulsory under the Universal Basic Education Program (UBEC).\n[\n28\n]\nTertiary institutions include public and private universities, polytechnics, and colleges of education. Universities can be funded by the federal government, state governments, religious institutions, or individuals and organisations.\nOwnership and operation\nMany schools are owned or funded by\nstates\n.\nPrivate schools\noperate independently from the government.\n[\n29\n]\n[\nbetter source needed\n]\nPrivate schools usually rely on fees from families whose children attend the school for funding; however, sometimes such schools also receive government support (for example, through\nSchool vouchers\n). Many private schools are affiliated with a particular religion; these are known as\nparochial schools\n.\n[\n30\n]\nComponents of most schools\nSee also:\nLearning environment\nand\nLearning space\nA school entrance building in Australia\nSchools are organized spaces purposed for teaching and learning. The classrooms where teachers teach and students learn are of central importance. Classrooms may be specialized for certain subjects, such as laboratory classrooms for science education and workshops for\nindustrial arts\neducation.\nTypical schools have many other rooms and areas, which may include:\n[\n31\n]\nCafeteria\n(Commons), dining hall or canteen where students eat lunch and often breakfast and snacks.\nAthletic field, playground,\ngym\n, or track place where students participating in sports or\nphysical education\npractice\nSchoolyards, all-purpose playfields typically in\nelementary schools\n, often made of concrete.\nAuditorium or hall where student theatrical and musical productions can be staged and where all-school events such as assemblies are held\nOffice where the administrative work of the school is done\nLibrary where students ask librarians reference questions, check out books and magazines, and often use computers\nComputer labs\nwhere computer-based work is done and the internet accessed\nCultural activities\nwhere the students uphold their cultural practice through activities like games, dance, and music\nArchitecture\nA classroom block with schoolbag racks in\nWestern Sydney\n, Australia\nThis section is an excerpt from\nEducational architecture\n.\n[\nedit\n]\nPrinceton University Graduate College\n(1913), designed by\nRalph Adams Cram\nin the\nCollegiate Gothic\nstyle\nEducational architecture\n, also known as school architecture or school building design, is a specialized branch of commercial\narchitecture\nwhere the building design is focused for the primary purpose of educational instruction, such as schools and\nuniversities\n, as well as other educational institutions. The design of a building can significantly influence the learning experience of students.\n[\n32\n]\nAdditionally, because schools are important sources of traffic, employment and community activities, school buildings often act as anchor institutions in neighborhoods or communities.\n[\n33\n]\n[\n34\n]\nVarious countries have gone through significant changes in philosophies associated with educational institutions, influenced by trends in investment by governments as well as larger changes in\neducational philosophy.\nEducation facilities in low-income countries\nIn\nlow-income countries\n, only 32% of primary, 43% of lower secondary and 52% of upper secondary schools have access to\nelectricity\n.\n[\n35\n]\nThis affects access to the\ninternet\n, which is just 37% in upper secondary schools in low-income countries, as compared to 59% in those in middle-income countries and 93% in those in\nhigh-income countries\n.\n[\n35\n]\nAccess to basic\nwater\n,\nsanitation\nand\nhygiene\nis also far from universal. Among upper secondary schools, only 53% in low-income countries and 84% in middle-income countries have access to basic drinking water. Access to water and sanitation is universal in high-income countries.\n[\n35\n]\nSecurity\nMain article:\nSchool security\nTo curtail violence, some schools have added\nCCTV\nsurveillance\ncameras. This is especially common in schools with\ngang activity\nor violence.\nThe safety of staff and students is increasingly becoming an issue for school communities in the U.S., an issue most schools are addressing through improved security. Some have also taken measures such as installing\nmetal detectors\nor\nvideo surveillance\n. Others have even taken measures such as having the children swipe identification cards as they board the school bus. These plans have included door numbering to aid public safety response for some schools.\n[\n36\n]\nOther security concerns faced by schools include bomb threats, gangs, and vandalism.\n[\n37\n]\nIn recognition of these threats, the United Nations\nSustainable Development Goal 4\nadvocates for upgrading education facilities to provide a safe, non-violent learning environment.\n[\n38\n]\nHealth services\nMain article:\nSchool health services\nSchool health services are services from medical, teaching and other professionals applied in or out of school to improve the health and well-being of children and, in some cases, whole families. These services have been developed in different ways around the globe. However, the fundamentals are constant: the early detection, correction, prevention, or amelioration of disease, disability, and abuse from which school-aged children can suffer.\nOnline schools and classes\nMain article:\nVirtual school\nSome schools offer remote access to their classes over the internet. Online schools also can provide support to traditional schools, as in the case of the\nSchool Net Namibia\n. Some online classes also provide experience in a class. When people take them, they have already been introduced to the subject and know what to expect. Classes provide high school/college credit, allowing students to take the classes at their own pace. Many online classes cost money to take, but some are offered free.\nA staged example of an online classroom using\nJitsi\n. The teacher is sharing their screen.\nInternet-based distance learning programs are offered widely through many universities. Instructors teach through online activities and assignments. Online classes are taught the same as in-person, with the same curriculum. The instructor offers the syllabus with their fixed requirements like any other class. Students can virtually turn their assignments in to their instructors according to deadlines. This being through via email or on the course webpage. This allows students to work at their own pace yet meet the correct deadlines. Students taking an online class have more flexibility in their schedules to take their classes at a time that works best.\nConflicts with taking an online class may include not being face to face with the instructor when learning or being in an environment with other students. Online classes can also make understanding the content challenging, especially when unable to get in quick contact with the instructor. Online students have the advantage of using other online sources with assignments or exams for that specific class. Online classes also have the advantage of students not needing to leave their house for a morning class or worrying about their attendance for that class. Students can work at their own pace to learn and achieve within that curriculum.\n[\n39\n]\nThe convenience of learning at home has been an attraction point for enrolling online. Students can attend class anywhere a computer can go – at home, in a library, or while traveling internationally. Online school classes are designed to fit a student's needs while allowing students to continue working and tending to their other obligations.\n[\n40\n]\nOnline school education is divided into three subcategories: Online Elementary School, Online Middle School, Online High school.\nStress\nSee also:\nCram school\nAs a profession, teaching has levels of\nwork-related stress\n(WRS)\n[\n41\n]\nthat are among the highest of any profession in some countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States.\n[\n42\n]\nThe degree of this problem is becoming increasingly recognized and support systems are being put into place.\n[\n43\n]\n[\n44\n]\nStress sometimes affects students more severely than teachers, up to the point where the students are prescribed stress medication. This stress is claimed to be related to standardized testing, and the pressure on students to score above average.\n[\n45\n]\n[\n46\n]\nAccording to a 2008 mental health study by the Associated Press and mtvU,\n[\n47\n]\neight in 10 U.S. college students said they had sometimes or frequently experienced stress in their daily lives. This was an increase of 20% from a survey five years previously. Thirty-four percent had felt depressed at some point in the past three months, 13 percent had been diagnosed with a mental health condition such as an anxiety disorder or depression, and 9 percent had seriously considered suicide.\n[\n47\n]\nDiscipline towards students\nMain article:\nSchool discipline\nSchools and their teachers have always been under pressure – for instance, pressure to cover the curriculum, perform well compared to other schools, and avoid the stigma of being \"soft\" or \"spoiling\" toward students. Forms of discipline, such as control over when students may speak, and normalized behaviour, such as raising a hand to speak, are imposed in the name of greater efficiency. Practitioners of\ncritical pedagogy\nmaintain that such disciplinary measures have no positive effect on student learning. Indeed, some argue that disciplinary practices detract from learning, saying that they undermine students' dignity and sense of\nself-worth\n– the latter occupying a more primary role in students'\nhierarchy of needs\n.\nCriticism\nThis section is an excerpt from\nCriticism of schooling\n.\n[\nedit\n]\nAnti-schooling activism\n, or radical education reform, describes positions that are critical of school as a learning institution and/or\ncompulsory schooling\nlaws\n; or multiple attempts and approaches to fundamentally change the\nschool system\n. People of this movement usually advocate\nalternatives to the traditional school system\n,\neducation independent from school\n, the\nabsence of the concept of schooling\nas a whole, or the right that people can choose\nhow, where and with whom they are educated\n.\nThese attitudes criticize the\nlearning atmosphere and environment\nof school and oppose the educational monopoly of school and the conventional standard and practice of schooling for reasons such as:\nregarding the use of compulsory schooling as a tool of assimilation;\nthe belief that an overly structured and predetermined learning system can be detrimental for children and would encourage certain temperaments while inhibiting others;\n[\n48\n]\nthe related belief that the school environment prevents learning rather than encouraging the innate natural curiosity by using unnatural extrinsic pressures such as\ngrades\nand\nhomework\n;\n[\n49\n]\nthe view that school prescribes students exactly what to do, how, when, where and with whom, which would suppress\ncreativity\n,\n[\n50\n]\nand/or the conviction that schooling is used as a form of political or governmental control for the implementation of certain ideologies in the population.\n[\n51\n]\nAnother very persistent argument of anti-schooling activists is that school does not prepare children for life outside of school,\n[\n52\n]\nand that many teachers do not have a neutral view of the world because they have only attended academic institutions a large part of their life.\nOthers criticize the forced contact in school and are of the opinion that school makes children spend a large part of their most important development phase in a building, in seclusion from society, exclusively with children in their own age group, seated and entrusted with the task of obeying the orders of one authority figure for several hours each day, while almost everything they do is assessed, which would be a dehumanizing experience.\n[\n53\n]\nSome may also feel a deep aversion to school based on their personal experiences or question the efficiency and sustainability of school learning and are of the opinion that compulsory schooling represents an impermissible interference with the rights and freedoms of parents and children; and believe that schools as a vehicle for knowledge transfer are no longer necessary and increasingly becoming obsolete in times of rapid information procurement, e.g. via the internet, and therefore generally consider\ncompulsory education\nwith\nevidence-based learning\n-oriented\nonline schools\nor\nautodidactism\nto be more sensible than the traditional\ncohort\n-based physical schools.\n[\n54\n]\nSee also\nSchools portal\nEducation portal\nBullying in teaching\nEducational technology\nSchool pedagogy\nFree education\nLists of colleges and universities by country\nLists of schools by country\nList of songs about school\nList of television series about school\nMobile phone use in schools\nMusic school\nSecular education\nSchool bullying\nSchool meal\nSchool story\nSchool uniform\nSchool-to-prison pipeline\nMilitary academy\nStudent transport\nTeaching for social justice\nUniversity-preparatory school\nYear-round school\nNight school\nReferences\n^\nKuhlmann, Stefan (27 January 2017).\nResearch Handbook on Innovation Governance for Emerging Economies: Towards Better Models\n.

With 69,818 students as of the fall 2024 semester, UCF has the\nsecond largest on-campus student body of any public university in the United States\n. UCF is\nclassified\namong \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research spending and doctorate production\" and is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the\nSouthern Association of Colleges and Schools\n.\n[\n2\n]\nUCF was founded in 1963 and opened its first classes in 1968 as\nFlorida Technological University\n, with the mission to provide personnel educated in science, technology, engineering and math  to support the growing\nU.S. space program\nat the\nKennedy Space Center\nand\nCape Canaveral Space Force Station\n(known at the time as Cape Kennedy Air Force Station) on Florida's\nSpace Coast\n.\n[\n7\n]\nAs its academic scope expanded beyond engineering and technology, Florida Tech was renamed the University of Central Florida in 1978.\n[\n8\n]\nUCF continues to have space root connections, as it developed and oversees the\nFlorida Space Institute\n,\nRobinson Observatory\n, manages the\nNational Astronomy and Ionosphere Center\n, and is the leader of the NASA Florida Space Grant Consortium.\n[\n9\n]\nInitial enrollment in 1968 was 1,948 students;\n[\n10\n]\nenrollment in 2024 exceeds 68,000 students from 142 countries and all 50 states.\n[\n11\n]\nMost students attend classes on the university's main campus, 13 miles (21 km) east of\ndowntown Orlando\nand 35 miles (56 km) west of\nCape Canaveral\n.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n12\n]\nUCF offers more than 230 degrees through 13 colleges including the Health Sciences Campus at\nLake Nona Medical City\n, the\nRosen College of Hospitality Management\nin south\nOrlando\nand the city campus in downtown Orlando.\n[\n13\n]\nSince its founding, UCF has awarded more than 437,000 degrees, including over 60,000 graduate and professional degrees.\n[\n2\n]\nIts official colors are black and gold, and the university academic seal features\nPegasus\n, which \"symbolizes the university's vision of limitless possibilities\".\n[\n14\n]\nThe university's intercollegiate sports teams, known as the\nUCF Knights\nand represented by mascot\nKnightro\n, compete in\nNCAA Division I\nand in the\nBig 12 Conference\n, except for Men's Soccer, which competes in the\nSun Belt Conference\n.\n[\n15\n]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nFounding\n[\nedit\n]\nFollowing President\nJohn F. Kennedy\n's\nSeptember 1962 speech \"We choose to go to the Moon\"\n, in which he described his goal of accomplishing a\ncrewed space flight to the Moon\nby the end of the decade, the space program grew in importance and scope in Central Florida because of its proximity to\nCape Canaveral\n.\n[\n16\n]\nProminent residents and local leaders began lobbying the\nFlorida State Legislature\nto increase access to higher education on the\nSpace Coast\n. With the help of former\nstate senate\npresident\nWilliam A. Shands\nand Senator\nBeth Johnson\n, on June 10, 1963, the legislature passed and\nGovernor\nFarris Bryant\nsigned into law Senate Bill No. 125, which authorized the\nFlorida Board of Regents\nto create a new\nstate university\nin East Central Florida.\n[\n17\n]\nThe university was founded as a non-segregated and coeducational university, with the mission of educating students for space-age careers in engineering and other technological professions. Defense scientists and NASA met with students,\n[\nwhen?\n]\nrecruiting for the space program.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nOn January 24, 1964, the board of regents purchased 1,000 acres (400 hectares) of remote forest and pasture land along\nAlafaya Trail\n(SR 434) in northeast Orlando for $500,000 as the site of the new university.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nLocal residents donated another 227 acres (92 hectares), and raised more than $1 million in funds to secure the land acquisition.\n[\n17\n]\nIn December 1965, the board of regents appointed\nCharles Millican\nthe\nfirst president\nof the new university.\n[\n18\n]\nWith the consultation of a citizen advisory group, Millican chose the name Florida Technological University, as well as co-designed the school's distinctive Pegasus seal.\n[\n19\n]\nMillican is also responsible for the university's slogan, \"Reach for the Stars\", for the two key principles of the school, \"accent on excellence\" and \"accent on the individual\", and for the campus's unique pedestrian-oriented concentric-circle layout, which was based on plans by\nWalt Disney\nand has become a model for other universities.\n[\n20\n]\nMillican and then-Governor\nClaude Kirk\npresided over FTU's groundbreaking in March 1967. On October 7, 1968, the inaugural classes were held in the school's first academic building. 1,948 students were enrolled in 55 degree programs within five colleges, led by 90 instructors and aided by 150 staff members, during the university's first year.\n[\n21\n]\nFTU graduated its first class of 423 seniors on June 14, 1970, with\nastronaut\nand Orlando native\nJohn Young\ngiving the commencement address.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nMillican selected the university's official colors, and had a role in selecting its first mascot, the\nCitronaut\n, a mix of an orange and an astronaut.\n[\n22\n]\nThe\nCitronaut\nproved unpopular, so in 1969 the student newspaper,\nThe Central Florida Future\n, encouraged mascot suggestions from students and faculty. The search for a replacement proved unsuccessful until 1970, when Judy Hines, a night nurse, proposed Vincent the Vulture. He served as the university's unofficial mascot for more than a year. In late 1971, students voted and selected the Knight of Pegasus as the school's official athletic mascot.\n[\n23\n]\nThe nickname later evolved to the Golden Knights and eventually to the Knights.\nAfter retiring as president in 1978, Millican identified his proudest moment leading the school as when President\nRichard Nixon\ndelivered the university's spring 1973 commencement address.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nExpansion\n[\nedit\n]\nEntering office in 1978, the university's second president,\nTrevor Colbourn\n, recognized the diversification and growth of UCF's academic programs away from its strictly technological and scientific beginnings.\n[\n24\n]\nAs the university developed strong business, education, and liberal arts programs, Colbourn recognized that the university's name no longer reflected its mission. From its establishment the university was known as Florida Technological University, nicknamed Florida Tech, until December 1978 when Governor\nReubin Askew\nsigned legislation changing the school's name to the University of Central Florida.\n[\n5\n]\nColbourn established the university's\nhonors program\n, and started the university's first satellite campus\n[\nwhere?\n]\n. In addition, he was responsible for constructing the\nCentral Florida Research Park\nadjacent to the UCF campus, founded in 1978. The park serves as a major focus of\nsimulation\nfor\nspace\nand\ndefense\n-related research. It was part of Colbourn's plan to make UCF a world-class partnership university. Among the university's first partners were\nLockheed Martin\nand the\nUnited States Navy\n, and Colbourn led the push to found both the\nInstitute for Simulation and Training\nand the\nCenter for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers\nin 1986.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nDuring his tenure, enrollment increased from 11,000 in 1978 to over 18,000 in 1989.\n[\n25\n]\nColbourn also supported the university's athletic programs. He was responsible for establishing the school's\nfootball program\nin 1979, which began an era of growth for the university.\n[\naccording to whom?\n]\nIn April 1979, UCF awarded its 15,000th degree.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nHitt presidency\n[\nedit\n]\nIn March 1992,\nJohn C. Hitt\nbecame UCF's fourth president. Once known mainly as a small commuter and technology school, UCF administrators began to increase its academic and research standing while also evolving into a more traditional research university. When Hitt took office, UCF's enrollment was 20,302. As of 2014, 60,821 students attended classes on 12 campuses spread across central Florida. The university consisted of 13 colleges and employed more than 10,150 faculty and staff.\n[\n5\n]\nDuring this time, UCF raised admissions standards, increased research funding, built new facilities, and established notable partnerships with major research institutions.\n[\n26\n]\nThe university's athletic program also grew with an\non-campus football stadium\n,\nnew basketball arena\n, more on-campus housing, and the development of the\nUCF College of Medicine\nat Lake Nona.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nUntil 1999, the Knights were represented by a\njouster\nfrom the\nMedieval Times\ndinner show in nearby\nKissimmee, Florida\n. That same year,\nKnightro\nwas introduced at the staple homecoming event, Spirit Splash.\nDuring its spring 2010 graduation ceremonies, UCF awarded its 200,000th degree,\n[\n27\n]\nless than five years after awarding its 150,000th.\n[\n28\n]\nColbourn Hall scandal\n[\nedit\n]\nIn August 2018, the state university system's\nBoard of Governors\nand the\nFlorida Legislature\nopened an investigation into the university for misuse of state funds. On September 13, 2018, UCF admitted to misappropriating money intended for educational and operating expenses to build the new $38 million Trevor Colbourn Hall, leading to the resignation of CFO Bill Merck.\n[\n29\n]\nIn January 2019, UCF severed ties with President Emeritus John Hitt after the investigation proved that UCF had misspent or planned to misspend over $85 million between 2013 and 2018.\n[\n30\n]\nNewly appointed president\nDale Whittaker\n, who was a provost at UCF during Hitt's tenure, resigned in February 2019 after just seven months in office over allegations that he also knew about the misappropriation of funds.\n[\n31\n]\n[\n32\n]\nBoard of Trustees Chairman Marcos Marchena also resigned that month.\n[\n33\n]\nIn August 2019, the final report into additional UCF construction projects revealed the balance of misdirected funds between July 2010 and August 2018 was $99.61 million (equivalent to $147.07 million in 2025).\n[\n34\n]\nThe report found that key people in the university leadership were aware of the misdirection of the funds. UCF was fined by the state for 120% the cost of the misused funds.\n[\n35\n]\nCartwright presidency\n[\nedit\n]\nAlexander Cartwright\nis the fifth and current president of UCF. He became the president on April 13, 2020, succeeding acting president Thad Seymore, who took over following Whittaker's resignation in February 2019.\nCampuses\n[\nedit\n]\nMain campus\n[\nedit\n]\nThe University of Central Florida main campus is located in the\nUniversity\ncensus-designated place\n,\n[\n36\n]\nalong\nAlafaya Trail\neast of\nOrlando\n, Florida.\n[\n37\n]\nMemory Mall\nThe campus is designed to be pedestrian-oriented, with a series of concentric circles.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe outermost circle is Gemini Blvd, which is also the main road for vehicular traffic on campus.

Washington included a bequest of his shares in the\nPotomac Company\nto establish the university in his last will and testament, though the shares lost their value and no educational institution ever benefited from them.\n[\n17\n]\n[\n16\n]\nFollowing his death, his desire was shared and encouraged by U.S. presidents\nThomas Jefferson\nand\nJames Madison\n, who both expressed the need to carry out Washington's plans.\n[\n18\n]\nIn 1821, the\nBaptist\nmissionary and leading\nminister\nLuther Rice\nsecured funds from\nJames Monroe\n,\nJohn Quincy Adams\n,\nJohn C. Calhoun\n, and other benefactors for a college to educate citizens from throughout the young nation in\nWashington, D.C.\n[\n19\n]\nA large building was constructed on College Hill, which is now known as\nMeridian Hill\n. On February 9, 1821, President Monroe approved the\ncongressional charter\n, creating the non-denominational\nColumbian College.\n[\n20\n]\nWashingtonians, Congress, and the academic community celebrated this new institution as the fulfillment of Washington's vision.\n[\n17\n]\nIn 1824, the first commencement was considered an important event for the young city. In attendance were President Monroe, John C. Calhoun,\nHenry Clay\n, the\nMarquis de Lafayette\n, and other dignitaries.\n[\n21\n]\nFreemasonry symbols are prominently displayed throughout the campus, including the foundation stones of many of the university buildings.\n[\n22\n]\n19th century\n[\nedit\n]\nDuring the 19th century, most of the university's students came from the\nSouth\n. As the\nAmerican Civil War\ncommenced in 1861, many left their studies to join the\nConfederate States Army\n. However, the college was still fractured. Professor of anatomy\nA. Y. P. Garnett\nleft the university to serve as\nJefferson Davis\n' physician, and\nRobert King Stone\nstayed in Washington, D.C., serving as physician to\nAbraham Lincoln\n. The college was temporarily turned into a\nUnion Army\nmilitary camp during the Civil War. Poet\nWalt Whitman\nworked at this camp while visiting his wounded brother.\n[\n23\n]\nIn 1873, following the Civil War, Columbian College was renamed\nColumbian University\nand moved to an urban downtown location centered on\n15th\nand\nH streets\n.\n[\n24\n]\n20th century\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 1904, Columbian University was renamed George Washington University following an agreement with the\nGeorge Washington Memorial Association\n.\n[\n25\n]\nIn honor of George Washington, funds from the memorial association were donated to construct\nLisner Auditorium\n.\n[\n26\n]\nAn engraving of the university's first building on Meridian Hill,\nc.\n1821\nIn 1912, the university moved its principal operations to the\nFoggy Bottom\nneighborhood of Washington, D.C.\n[\n27\n]\nMany of the colleges of the George Washington University are notable for their age and history. The law school is the oldest law school in the District of Columbia.\n[\n28\n]\nThe medical school is the 11th-oldest medical school in the nation and the first established in the nation's capital.\n[\n29\n]\nThe Columbian College was founded in 1821 and is the oldest unit of the university. The Elliott School of International Affairs was formalized in 1898.\n[\n30\n]\nIn the 1930s, the university was a major center for\ntheoretical physics\n.\nGeorge Gamow\n, a cosmologist, developed the\nBig Bang theory\nat the university in the 1930s and 1940s. On January 26, 1939,\nNiels Bohr\nannounced that\nOtto Hahn\nhad successfully split the atom at the Fifth Washington Conference on theoretical physics in the Hall of Government.\n[\n31\n]\nDuring the\nVietnam War\nera, Thurston Hall, an undergraduate dormitory housing 1,116 students at 1900 F Street NW, located three blocks from the\nWhite House\n,\n[\n32\n]\nwas a staging ground for student\nanti-war\ndemonstrations.\nIn 1996, the university purchased the\nMount Vernon College for Women\nin the city's\nPalisades\nneighborhood that became the school's coeducational Mount Vernon Campus. The campus was first utilized in 1997 for women only but became co-educational in a matter of years.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe Mount Vernon campus is now totally integrated into the GW community, serving as a complement to the Foggy Bottom campus.

During the period in between, on-campus food options were limited.\n[\n34\n]\nIn July 2020, the university began forming special committees to look at possible name changes to an on-campus building and the school moniker. In a statement on the university's website, LeBlanc said one of the panels would examine the Colonials moniker, which critics said conjured up racism, violence, and genocide. In 2022, the Colonials name was officially retired. The following year, in 2023, the new nickname, the\nGeorge Washington Revolutionaries\n, was announced.\n[\n35\n]\nAnother panel looked into renaming the Marvin Center, which was named after former school President\nCloyd Heck Marvin\n, a\nsegregationist\n.\n[\n36\n]\nIn January 2022, LeBlanc was succeeded by former\nWashington University in St. Louis\nChancellor\nMark S.

The University Yard is the main open space and historic heart of the university. Along with George Washington's main library,\nGelman Library\n, it constitutes the hub of the main campus. The seven-story Gelman Library building contains over two million volumes and is constructed in the\nBrutalist\narchitectural style\nof the 1970s. It features a concrete façade punctuated by windows that are divided by projecting vertical slabs. For most of the year, parts of the library are open 24 hours a day, seven days per week for use by students, faculty, and staff. The library's seventh floor includes the Special Collections Research Center,\nNational Security Archives\n, Global Resources Center, and Kiev Library.\nThe\nNational Security Archives\n(NSA) is a research institution that publishes declassified U.S. government files concerning selected topics of\nAmerican foreign policy\n.

Seaholm\n(retired Chief Engineer for Cadillac)\n[\n4\n]\nand the treasurer was Wylie E. Groves. Birmingham's two high schools are now named for them: Seaholm High School and\nGroves High School\n. Birmingham High School's first principal was Ross Wagner. John Schulz served as the next principal (1968–1979), Jim Wallendorf followed, serving from 1979 to 1992.  The current serving principal is Micheal Wicker.\nAt one time Seaholm High School hosted classes of grades 4 through 12 of the\nJapanese School of Detroit\n, a\nsupplementary Japanese school\n.\n[\n5\n]\nIn 2010, the JSD announced that it was relocating to\nNovi, Michigan\n;\n[\n6\n]\nit moved in mid-2011.\n[\n7\n]\nPrograms\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nForensics\nTeam has consistently enjoyed success at the state-finalist level.\nQuiz Bowl\nteam has also had success, winning a national championship in 1991 at the American Scholastics Competition Network Tournament of Champions and a state championship in 1994.\n[\n8\n]\nThe student newspaper, the\nSeaholm Highlander\n, has won multiple prestigious Spartan Awards from the Michigan Interscholastic Press Association.\nThe Flexible Scheduling Program, which involved a seven teacher team that created a series of interdisciplinary social studies/humanities courses with flexible schedules, began in the 1960s. They may be taken in lieu of standard English and social studies classes. Students are permitted to teach courses themselves. According to the\nChristian Science Monitor\n, the reduction in bureaucracy, interaction and collaboration between teachers, the interdisciplinary nature, and flexible time schedules made the program attractive.\n[\n9\n]\nNotable alumni\n[\nedit\n]\nTim Allen\n, actor and comedian\n[\n10\n]\nParis Bass\n, pro basketball player\nJim Benton\n, illustrator and writer\nMike Binder\n, film director, screenwriter, producer, and actor\n[\n11\n]\nRandal Bryant\n, computer scientist and academic\nCharlie Burg\n, singer-songwriter\nJohn N.

Founded in 1870, it is the\nflagship\ninstitution of the\nUniversity System of Ohio\n.\n[\n7\n]\nIt is designated a\nland-grant\n,\n[\n8\n]\nsea-grant\n,\n[\n9\n]\nand\nspace-grant\n[\n10\n]\nuniversity by the\nGovernment of Ohio\n.\n[\n11\n]\nOhio State is one of the\nlargest universities by enrollment\nin the United States, with over 50,000 undergraduate students and 15,000 graduate students. Ohio State is a member of the\nAssociation of American Universities\nand is\nclassified\namong \"\nR1\n: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity spending and doctorate production\".\n[\n12\n]\nIn 2026 the university had\nresearch and development\n(R&D) expenditures of $1.58 billion, the 12th largest in the United States.\n[\n13\n]\nThe university consists of sixteen\ncolleges\n, including of\nArts and Sciences\n,\nBusiness\n,\nDentistry\n,\nEngineering\n,\nPublic Affairs\n, and\nLaw\n, and offers study in a wide range of degree programs at the\nundergraduate\nand\ngraduate\nlevels.\n[\n14\n]\nIt has five\nsatellite campuses\nin\nLima\n,\nMansfield\n,\nMarion\n,\nNewark\n, and\nWooster\n. Its athletic teams compete in\nNCAA Division I\nwithin the\nBig Ten Conference\nfor the large majority of sports.\nAlumni and faculty include 6\nNobel Prize\nlaureates, 9\nRhodes Scholars\n,\n[\n15\n]\n7\nChurchill Scholars\n,\n[\n16\n]\n1\nFields Medalist\n,\n[\n17\n]\n8\nPulitzer Prize\nwinners,\n[\n18\n]\n77\nGoldwater scholars\n,\n[\n19\n]\n1\nCosta Rican president\n, 1\nU.S. vice president\n, 7\nU.S. senators\n,\n[\n20\n]\n15\nU.S. representatives\n, and 118\nOlympic medalists\n.\nHistory\nMain article:\nHistory of Ohio State University\n19th century\nUniversity Hall\nwas the first building on campus, built in 1873 and reconstructed in 1976\nThe proposal of a manufacturing and agriculture university in central Ohio was initially met in the 1870s with hostility from the state's agricultural interests, and with competition for resources from\nOhio University\n, which was chartered by the\nNorthwest Ordinance\nand\nMiami University\n.\n[\n21\n]\nThe university was established in the year 1870 as a\nland-grant university\n.\n[\n21\n]\nThe university opened its doors to 24 students on September 17, 1873. In 1878, the first class of six men graduated. The first woman graduated the following year.\n[\n22\n]\nAlso in 1878, the Ohio legislature recognized an expanded scope for the university by changing its name to \"the Ohio State University\".\n[\n23\n]\n[\n24\n]\n20th century\nA view of The Oval green space in the early 20th century\nIn 1906, Ohio State president\nWilliam Oxley Thompson\n, along with the university's supporters in the state legislature, put forth the\nLybarger Bill\nwith the aim of shifting virtually all higher education support to the continued development of Ohio State while funding only the \"\nnormal school\n\" functions of the state's other public universities. Although the Lybarger Bill failed narrowly to gain passage, in its place the\nEagleson Bill\nwas passed as a compromise, which determined that all doctoral education and research functions would be the role of Ohio State, and that Miami University and Ohio University would not offer instruction beyond the master's degree level – an agreement that would remain in place until the 1950s. In 1916, Ohio State was elected into membership in the\nAssociation of American Universities\n.\n[\n12\n]\nWith the onset of the\nGreat Depression\n, Ohio State would face many of the challenges affecting universities throughout America as budget support was slashed, and students without the means of paying tuition returned home to support families. By the mid-1930s, however, enrollment had stabilized due in large part to the role of the\nFederal Emergency Relief Administration\nand later the\nNational Youth Administration\n.\n[\n25\n]\nBy the end of the decade, enrollment had still managed to grow to over 17,500. In 1934, the Ohio State Research Foundation was founded to bring in outside funding for faculty research projects. In 1938, a development office was opened to begin raising funds privately to offset reductions in state support.\nIn 1952, Ohio State founded the\ninterdisciplinary\nMershon Center for International Security Studies\n, which it still houses. In 1986, Ohio State ended its historic\nopen enrollment\npolicy and moved towards selective admissions.\n[\n26\n]\nThe university jointed several other\ngrants\nin the late 1980s. It was designed a\nspace-grant institution\nin 1988.\n[\n9\n]\nIt was designed a\nsea-grant\ninstitution one year later, in 1989.\n[\n9\n]\n21st century\nThe 2020s were marked by internal divisions over politics.\n[\n27\n]\nIn 2020,\nKristina M. Johnson\ntook office as the 16th president.\n[\n28\n]\nHer tenure was marked by the university incorporating various\ndiversity, equity, and inclusion\npolicies, which led to criticism from\nconservatives\n.\n[\n27\n]\nAlong with other public universities in the state, DEI policies were banned in 2025 with the\nAdvance Ohio Higher Education Act\n, which passed the\nOhio State Legislature\nand was signed by Governor\nMike DeWine\n. In 2023,\nWalter E. Carter Jr.\ntook office as the 17th president.\n[\n29\n]\nHis tenure has been described as either more politically neutral or conservative than Johnson's,\n[\n30\n]\nrolling back many of her perceived\nprogressive\npolicies.\n[\n27\n]\nProtests at Ohio State University\nby pro-Palestinian demonstrators have occurred during the\nGaza War\n, demanding \"\nfinancial divestment, academic boycott, financial disclosure, acknowledging the genocide, and ending targeted policing\n\".\n[\n31\n]\nA solidarity encampment was constructed on OSU's South Oval on April 25, 2025 during which there were at least 36 arrests.\n[\n32\n]\nIn January 2025, the defense technology company\nAnduril Industries\nannounced a series of Arsenal Projects,\nhyperscaling computer\nfacilities for\nautonomous sensors and weapons\n.\n[\n33\n]\nAnduril announced the construction of a manufacturing facility in\nColumbus, Ohio\n, to be named \"Arsenal-1\", with subsequent Arsenals planned.\n[\n34\n]\n[\n35\n]\nThe facility has been noted for its close ties with Ohio State University, with Anduril Industries sponsoring\nthe football program\nfor the 2025 to 2026 year, close ties to the current college administration, and many of Anduril-1's employees hailing from its\napplied science\nprograms at the university.\n[\n36\n]\n[\n11\n]\nCampuses\nSee also:\nList of buildings at Ohio State University\nMain (Columbus)\nThe\nOhio Union\nwas the first\nstudent union\nat a state university in the United States.\n[\n37\n]\nOhio State's 1,764-acre (7.14 km\n2\n) main campus is about 2.5 miles (4.0 km) north of Columbus' downtown. The historical center of campus is the Oval, a\nquad\nof about 11 acres (4.5 ha).\n[\n38\n]\nThe original campus was laid out in the English country style with University Hall overlooking what would become the Oval. From 1905 to 1913, the\nOlmsted brothers\n, who had designed New York City's\nCentral Park\n, were contracted as architectural consultants. Under their leadership, a more formal landscape plan was created with its center axis through the Oval. This axis shifted the university's street grid 12.25 degrees from the City of Columbus' street grid. Construction of the main library in 1915 reinforced this grid shift.\n[\n39\n]\nOhio State's\nresearch library\nsystem has a combined collection of over 5.8 million volumes. Along with 21 libraries on its Columbus campus, the university has eight branches at off-campus research facilities and regional campuses, and a book storage depository near campus. In all, the Ohio State library system encompasses 55 branches and specialty collections. Some more significant collections include the\nByrd Polar Research Center\nArchival Program, which has the archives of Admiral\nRichard E. Byrd\nand other polar research materials; the\nHilandar Research Library\n, which has the world's largest collection of\nmedieval\nSlavic\nmanuscripts on microform; the\nOhio State Cartoon Library & Museum\n, the world's largest repository of original cartoons; the Lawrence and Lee Theatre Research Institute.\nThe East Atrium at the\nWilliam Oxley Thompson Memorial Library\nAnd the archives of Senator\nJohn Glenn\nAnchoring the traditional campus gateway at the eastern end of the Oval is the 1989\nWexner Center for the Arts\n. Designed by architects\nPeter Eisenman\nof New York and Richard Trott of Columbus, the center was funded in large part by Ohio State alumnus Les Wexner's gift of $25 million in the 1980s. The center was founded to encompass all aspects of visual and performing arts with a focus on new commissions and artist residencies.  Part of its design was to pay tribute to the armory that formerly had the same location. Its groundbreaking\ndeconstructivist\narchitecture has resulted in it being lauded as one of the most important buildings of its generation. Its design has also been criticized as proving less than ideal for many of the art installations it has attempted to display. The centerpiece of the Wexner Center's permanent collection is\nPicasso\n's\nNude on a Black Armchair\n, which was purchased by Wexner at auction for $45 million.\nTo the south of the Oval is another, somewhat smaller expanse of green space commonly referred to as the South Oval. At its eastern end, it is anchored by the Ohio Union. To the west are Hale Hall, the Kuhn Honors House, Browning Amphitheatre (a traditional stone\nGreek theatre\n) and\nMirror Lake\n.\nKnowlton Hall\n, dedicated in October 2004, is at the corner of West Woodruff Avenue and Tuttle Park Place, next to\nOhio Stadium\n.\nAerial view of the main campus, with\nDrinko Hall\nand the South Oval in the foreground\nKnowlton Hall along with the\nFisher College of Business\nand Hitchcock Hall form an academic nucleus in the northwestern corner of North campus. Knowlton Hall was designed by Atlanta-based\nMack Scogin Merrill Elam\nalong with\nWSA Studio\nfrom Columbus. The Hall is home to the KSA Café, the disciplines of architecture, landscape architecture, city and regional planning, and about 550 undergraduate and graduate students. Knowlton Hall stands out from the general reddish-brown brick of Ohio State's campus with distinctive white marble tiles that cover the building's exterior. This unique wall cladding was requested by\nAustin E. Knowlton\n, the namesake of and main patron to the creation of Knowlton Hall. Knowlton also requested that five white marble columns be erected on the site, each column representing one of the classical orders of\narchitecture\n.\n[\n40\n]\nThe campus is served by the\nCampus Area Bus Service\n.\n[\n41\n]\nRegional campuses\nLima\nMain article:\nOhio State University at Lima\nThe Ohio State University at Lima\n(\nOhio State Lima\n) is a regional campus in\nLima, Ohio\nthat was established in 1960.

The first concluded in 1987 and raised $460 million, a record at the time for a public university. The \"Affirm Thy Friendship Campaign\" took place between 1995 and 2000. With an initial goal of raising $850 million, the campaign's final tally was $1.23 billion, placing Ohio State among the small group of public universities to have successfully conducted a $1 billion campaign.\n[\n54\n]\nAt his welcoming ceremony, returning President E. Gordon Gee announced in the fall of 2007 that Ohio State would launch a $2.5 billion fundraising campaign. In 2019, celebrating the university's 150th year, President Michael V.

The system consists of four physical campuses in\nKansas City\n,\nIndependence\n, and\nLee's Summit\n, as well as the MCC-Online campus. The campuses had a total enrollment of 13,376 for the fall semester of 2023.\n[\n1\n]\nThe college's athletic teams are known as the Wolves. It is not affiliated with\nMetropolitan Community College\nin Omaha, Nebraska.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nMCC is the oldest public college in Kansas City, Missouri, and the first community college established in the state of Missouri. It was founded in 1915 as Kansas City Polytechnic Institute, with its campus at 11th and Locust streets initially offering a junior college program, a teacher training school, a high school, a mechanic arts school, a trade school, and a business training school. As a junior college, it was one of the first institutions in the country to issue two-year associate degrees, and it was the third school in the country to be accredited by the\nNorth Central Association of Colleges and Schools\n, in 1918. It changed its name to Junior College of Kansas City in 1919.\n[\n2\n]\nIn 1964 the suburban school districts of Belton, Center, Grandview, Hickman Mills, Lee's Summit, North Kansas City, and Raytown joined the Kansas City district to form the Metropolitan Community College District. A Board of Trustees was publicly elected to take over fiduciary responsibility for the college from the Kansas City School District. Patrons of the Blue Springs, Park Hill, Independence, and Fort Osage school districts voted to join the college district in the 1980s and 1990s.\n[\n3\n]\nIn 2021, three more school districts voted to \"attach\" to the MCC district: Grain Valley, Liberty, and Oak Grove. That brought the number of K-12 school systems that are \"in district\" with MCC to 15.\nThe Longview, Maple Woods, and Penn Valley campuses opened for the 1969-70 academic year, although campus construction would continue for years afterward. Some Maple Woods classes, for instance, met in a church that first year. The Blue River campus in eastern Jackson County opened in 1997, and the Business & Technology campus near Interstate 435 and Front Street opened in 2002. The entire institution became known as Metropolitan Community College, instead of the plural Metropolitan Community Colleges, in 2005.\n[\n3\n]\nThe Business & Technology campus closed at the end of 2021, with its skilled trades programs relocating to three new facilities: the Engineering Technology building and Advanced Technical Skills Institute, both part of MCC-Penn Valley, and the Blue River East building east of the main MCC-Blue River campus in Independence.\nCampuses\n[\nedit\n]\nBlue River\nLongview\nMaple Woods\nPenn\nValley\nclass=notpageimage|\nMCC campus locations in Missouri\nPrior to the consolidation of the Metropolitan name the campuses had their own local names (e.g., Longview Community College, Maple Woods Community College, Penn Valley Community College).\nMCC-Blue River\ncampus is in Independence, Missouri. The campus opened in 1997. As of Fall 2022, the campus serves about 2,000 students per semester. In addition to a host of general education programs, MCC-Blue River is home to a well-regarded cybersecurity program. The Metropolitan Chorale of Kansas City is based at Blue River. Each spring, families descend on the campus for the annual All for the Children healthy families resource fair, which includes a massive candy egg hunt. The campus' Public Safety Institute trains peace officers, firefighters, and EMT-paramedics. Blue River is also home base for MCC's men's and women's soccer teams.\nMCC-Longview\nis located in Lee's Summit, Missouri. It opened in 1969. In 2001, Longview was selected as a\nTIME\nmagazine\n/\nThe Princeton Review\n\"College of the Year\" in recognition of its Writing Across the Curriculum program.\n[\n4\n]\nJackson County (Missouri) Executive and former Kansas City Royals great\nFrank White\nis a notable campus alumnus. In the fall of 2022, the campus served about 3,250 students. The campus includes a nationally known automotive technology program and the MCC-Longview Cultural Arts Center. Each spring since 2006, Longview invites the community to take part in its popular Flights of Fancy Mega Kite Festival. Longview's baseball team won the 2007 NJCAA Division II Baseball Championship.\n[\n5\n]\nMCC Wolves sports programs based at Longview: men's and women's golf and cross country, and women's volleyball.\nMCC-Maple Woods\nwas founded in 1969. Located in Kansas City's Northland, the campus is known for its veterinary technology, geographic information systems and foreign language interpreting programs. A new building, the Agriculture Annex, was slated to break ground in April 2024, with completion by end of the year. This northernmost MCC campus served about 3,770 students in Fall 2022. MCC Wolves sports teams based at Maple Woods are baseball and softball.\nAlbert Pujols\nplayed baseball for Maple Woods (when its sports teams were known as the Monarchs) before being drafted by the\nSt. Louis Cardinals\nin 1999. Maple Woods' Sports Training Center was recently expanded and is now home to the campus Fitness Center.\nMCC-Penn Valley\n, near\nPenn Valley Park\n, was founded in 1969. Located in midtown Kansas City, the campus is known for its Health Science Institute at 3444 Broadway, home to nursing and allied health programs and the Virtual Hospital; the English as a Second Language program; and the new Advanced Technical Skills Institute at 2944 Troost Ave. The campus is also home to the Francis Child Development Institute and the Carter Art Center. About 3,500 students were enrolled at Penn Valley in Fall 2022. Each September, MCC-Penn Valley welcomes the community to its free Jazz in the Valley festival. Penn Valley is home base for MCC's men's and women's basketball programs. The men's basketball team, then known as the Scouts, won the 1996\nNJCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship\nand was runner-up in 1997 and 2002. In 1991, Penn Valley hosted the seventh\nScience Olympiad\nNational Tournament.\nNotable alumni\n[\nedit\n]\nThis list of alumni\nmay not follow Wikipedia's\nverifiability\npolicy\n.\nPlease help\nimprove it\nby adding\nreliable sources\nfor existing names which prove they are alumni.

Founded in 1885 by the\n13th Arizona Territorial Legislature\n, it was the first university established in the\nArizona Territory\n. The University of Arizona is one of three universities governed by the\nArizona Board of Regents\n(the University of Arizona,\nArizona State University\n, and\nNorthern Arizona University\n). As of fall 2025\n[update]\n, the university enrolled 54,384 students in 22 separate colleges/schools, including the\nEller College of Management\n, the\nWyant College of Optical Sciences\n, the\nCollege of Medicine – Phoenix\n, the\nCollege of Medicine – Tucson\n, and the\nJames E. Rogers College of Law\n.\n[\n14\n]\nThe university is\nclassified\namong \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\". UA also is a member of the\nAssociation of American Universities\n. The University of Arizona is affiliated with two academic medical centers,\nBanner – University Medical Center Tucson\nand\nBanner – University Medical Center Phoenix\n.\nKnown as the\nArizona Wildcats\n(often shortened to \"Cats\"), the UA's intercollegiate athletic teams were members of the\nPac-12 Conference\nof the\nNCAA\n. The university joined the\nBig 12 Conference\non August 2, 2024.\n[\n15\n]\nUA athletes have won national titles in several sports, most notably men's basketball, baseball, and softball.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nOld Main in 1889\nAfter the passage of the\nMorrill Land-Grant Act of 1862\n, the push for a university in Arizona grew. The Arizona Territory's \"\nThieving Thirteenth\n\" Legislature approved the University of Arizona in 1885 and selected the city of Tucson to receive the appropriation to build the university. Tucson hoped to receive the appropriation for the territory's mental hospital, which carried a $100,000 allocation instead of the $25,000 allotted to the territory's only university (Arizona State University was also chartered in 1885, but it was created as Arizona's\nnormal school\n, and not a university\n[\n16\n]\n).\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nFlooding on the\nSalt River\ndelayed Tucson's legislators, and by they time they reached\nPrescott\n, back-room deals allocating the most desirable territorial institutions had been made. Tucson was largely disappointed with receiving what was viewed as an inferior prize.\nWith no parties willing to provide land for the new institution, the citizens of Tucson prepared to return the money to the Territorial Legislature until two gamblers and a saloon keeper decided to donate 40 acres to the Board of Regents.\n[\n17\n]\nConstruction of\nOld Main\n, the first building on campus, began on October 27, 1887, and classes met for the first time in 1891 with 32 students in Old Main, which is still in use today.\n[\n18\n]\nBecause there were no high schools in Arizona Territory, the university maintained separate preparatory classes for the first 23 years of operation.\n[\n19\n]\nIn 1924, during\nCloyd Marvin\n's tenure as president, the university was recognized by the\nAssociation of American Universities\n.\n[\n20\n]\nModern times\n[\nedit\n]\nThree professors were murdered at the school in a\nshooting\nin 2002. The perpetrator, who then shot himself, was a student who had failed out of the school. He mailed a 22-page letter to the\nArizona Daily Star\nannouncing his reasons, naming two of the killed professors in the letter; following the shooting, the\nDaily Star\nmade the controversial decision to publish the letter.\n[\n21\n]\nOn April 17, 2020, the University of Arizona announced temporary pay cuts and furloughs to its 15,000 employees as its Tucson campus shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All employees making up to $150,000 per year were furloughed, with the length determined by each employees' salary. For employees making more than $150,000 per year, pay cuts of 17% or 20% were instituted.\n[\n22\n]\nAlso in 2020, the University of Arizona announced it had purchased\nAshford University\nfrom\nZovio\nand renamed it\nThe University of Arizona Global Campus\n.\n[\n23\n]\nThe purchase was heavily criticized, particularly by University of Arizona faculty members.\n[\n24\n]\n[\n25\n]\nAs Ashford was being purchased by the University of Arizona, it was the subject of an investigation by the Attorney General of Massachusetts, a lawsuit from the Attorney General of California, and a formal notification of concern from the university's accreditor.\n[\n26\n]\n[\n27\n]\n[\n28\n]\nA university professor was murdered on campus in October 2022, by a former student.\n[\n29\n]\nFollowing the crime, the university commissioned an independent investigation of campus safety. Following that investigation and one of their own that faulted the university for failing to act on warnings and protect the campus, the university's faculty senate voted \"\nno confidence\n\" in the president and many other leaders at the university.\n[\n30\n]\nIn 2023, the University of Arizona faced a financial crisis, allegedly \"losing track of more than $240 million through accounting errors and flawed financial projections.\"\n[\n31\n]\nSubsequent investigative reporting by\nThe Arizona Republic\nlinked much of the crisis to the university's purchase of Ashford University, accusing university administrators of knowing that Ashford was experiencing \"a downward enrollment spiral that began years before [the purchase] and dismal graduation and retention rates\".\n[\n32\n]\nIn April 2024, the UA chapter of\nStudents for Justice in Palestine\njoined\nstudent protests across the USA\nagainst the\nwar in Gaza\n, during what they called \"\nIsraeli Apartheid\nWeek\".\n[\n33\n]\n[\n34\n]\nThe encampment was attacked and dispersed by police firing rubber bullets, tear gas and pepper balls. Bystanders and press were also hurt in the police violence.\n[\n35\n]\n[\n36\n]\n[\n37\n]\nThe students were protesting against UA involvement with companies supporting the \"\ngenocide\nand\nethnic cleansing\nin\nPalestine\n\" and called for\ndivestment\n.\n[\n38\n]\nCampus\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nUniversity of Arizona Campus Historic District\nUniversity of Arizona Mall\n\"Old Main\" was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.\nStudent Union, Old Main, and Forbes building\nThe main campus' 179 buildings sit on 380 acres (1.5 km\n2\n) in central Tucson, about one mile (1.6 km) northeast of downtown.\nRoy Place\n, a prominent\nTucson\narchitect, designed many of the early buildings, including the\nArizona State Museum\nbuildings (one of them the 1927 main library) and Centennial Hall. Place's use of red brick set the tone for the red brick facades that are a basic part of nearly all UA buildings: almost every UA building has red brick as a major component of the design, or at the very least, a stylistic accent to harmonize it with the other campus buildings.\n[\n39\n]\n[\n40\n]\nIn the early 1930s, Place updated the campus master plan, conceived by his architectural partner John Lyman in 1919 and modeled after the\nUniversity of Virginia\n.\n[\n41\n]\nThe campus is roughly divided into quadrants. The north and south sides of campus are delineated by a grassy expanse called the Mall, which stretches from Old Main eastward to the campus' eastern border at Campbell Avenue (a major north–south arterial street). The west and east sides of campus are separated roughly by Highland Avenue and the Student Union Memorial Center (see below).\nUA McClelland Hall, Eller College of Management\nThe science and mathematics buildings tend to be clustered in the southwest quadrant; the intercollegiate athletics facilities to the southeast; the arts and humanities buildings to the northwest (with the dance department being a major exception as its main facilities are far to the east end of campus), with the engineering buildings in the north central area. The optical and space sciences buildings are clustered on the east side of campus near the sports stadiums and the (1976) main library.\nSpeedway Boulevard, one of Tucson's primary east–west arterial streets, traditionally defined the northern boundary of campus but since the 1980s, several university buildings have been constructed directly on, and north of, this street, expanding into a neighborhood traditionally filled with apartment complexes and single-family homes. The university has purchased a handful of these apartment complexes for student housing in recent years.

In 1998, the team posted a school-record 12–1 season and made the\nHoliday Bowl\nin which it defeated the\nNebraska Cornhuskers\n. Arizona ended the season ranked 4th nationally in the coaches and API poll. The 1998 Holiday Bowl was televised on\nESPN\nand set the now-surpassed record of being the most-watched bowl game in the network's history. From November 2003 until October 2011, the program was led by\nMike Stoops\n, brother of\nBob Stoops\n, the head football coach at the\nUniversity of Oklahoma\n(the 2000\nBCS national champions\n); Stoops was fired on October 10, 2011. Former Michigan and\nWest Virginia\nhead coach\nRich Rodriguez\nwas hired on November 21, 2011, to lead the Wildcats. The announcement was made by UA athletic director\nGreg Byrne\nvia Twitter. In his first season, Rodriguez took the Wildcats to the\n2012 New Mexico Bowl\n, where they defeated the\nUniversity of Nevada\nWolf Pack. In his third season, the Wildcats won the Pac-12 South and played in the\n2014 Fiesta Bowl\n.\n[\n139\n]\nIn 2015, the Wildcats played in their fourth consecutive bowl game, defeating the University of New Mexico in the New Mexico Bowl.\n[\n140\n]\nIn 2017, they lost to the Purdue Boilermakers in the Foster Farms Bowl, the Wildcats 21st bowl game.\n[\n141\n]\nDave Heeke\nwas named Arizona's 13th Director of Athletics in February 2017 and officially started in that role on April 1, 2017. Heeke served as Athletics Director at\nCentral Michigan University\nfor 11 years and as a staff member in the\nUniversity of Oregon\nathletics department for 18 years. (\nGreg Byrne\nresigned from the post in January to accept the same role at the\nUniversity of Alabama\n.)\nRodriguez was relieved of his duties on January 2, 2018, in the wake of an internal university investigation of sexual harassment claims made by Rodriguez's former administrative assistant.\n[\n142\n]\nAfter a nationwide search and much media speculation,\nKevin Sumlin\nwas hired on January 14, 2018, as the new Wildcats head football coach. Sumlin was head coach at\nTexas A&M University\nand the\nUniversity of Houston\n. After a disappointing three-season tenure, with the Wildcats posting a 5–7 (4–5 in Pac-12) record in 2018 and a 4–8 record (2–7 in Pac-12) record in 2019, Sumlin was fired at the conclusion of the 2020 season (a truncated schedule due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\n).\nAfter a nationwide search and much media speculation, former college and NFL coach\nJedd Fisch\n(most recently the QB coach for the\nNew England Patriots\nand a previous assistant at\nUCLA\n,\nMichigan\n,\nMiami\nand\nMinnesota\n) was chosen as the Wildcats' 32nd head football coach, as announced in December 2020.\n[\n143\n]\nBaseball\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nArizona Wildcats baseball\nThe baseball team had its first season in 1904. The baseball team has captured four national championship titles in 1976, 1980, 1986 and 2012, with the first three coached by\nJerry Kindall\nand the most recent by\nAndy Lopez\n. Arizona baseball teams have appeared in the NCAA National Championship title series a total of 34 times,\n[\n144\n]\nincluding 1956, 1959, 1963, 1976, 1980, 1986, 2004, 2012, and 2016.

The program had only two appearances in its history prior to the last four years. Ten members received PAC-\n12\nacademic honors for their performance in the classroom.\nSoftball\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nArizona Wildcats softball\nThe Arizona softball team is among the top programs in the country. The softball team has won eight NCAA Women's College World Series titles, in 1991, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2006 and 2007 under head coach\nMike Candrea\n(NCAA Softball Championship). The team has appeared in the NCAA National Championship in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 1998, 2001, 2002, 2006, 2007 and 2010 (a feat second only to UCLA), and has reached the College World Series 19 times. The Arizona Wildcats softball team won their first Pac-12 Championship in ten years after defeating the No. 12 UCLA Bruins 7–2, and qualified for its 31st consecutive NCAA tournament, creating a new NCAA softball record.\n[\n149\n]\nCoach Candrea, along with former Arizona pitcher\nJennie Finch\n, led the 2004 U.S. Olympic softball team to a gold medal in Athens, Greece. The Wildcat softball team plays at Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium.\nGolf\n[\nedit\n]\nThe university's golf teams have also been notably successful. The men's team won a national championship in 1992 (\nNCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships\n), and has produced a number of successful professionals, most notably\nJim Furyk\n. The women's team won national championships in 1996, 2000 and 2018 (\nNCAA Women's Golf Championship\n). The women's golf program has produced professionals\nAnnika Sörenstam\n,\nLorena Ochoa\n, and\nErica Blasberg\n.\nMen's lacrosse\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nlacrosse\nclub team was founded in the mid-1960s. In the 1960s, Arizona was a Division I varsity program, coached by\nCarl Runk\n, an Arizona graduate and football player. In 1998, Runk retired after twenty-eight years at\nTowson University\nin\nMaryland\n.\n[\n150\n]\nOther\n[\nedit\n]\nMany other Wildcats have met with success at the university.\nAlix Creek\nand\nMichelle Oldham\nwon the NCAA Women's Doubles Tennis title in 1993, defeating Texas in the Final. Although surprising to some, the University of Arizona has a noteworthy history in\nice hockey\n. The school's club hockey team, formerly known as the\nIcecats\n, won over 800 games between its inception in 1979 and 2011. The Ice Cats defeated\nPenn State\nfor the National Collegiate Club Hockey National Championship in 1985. They also appeared in eight Final Fours ('84, '86, '87, '88, '91, '93, '94, '97) and ten Elite Eights. As of 2011\n[update]\n, they are part of\nACHA\nDivision I, and are known formally as the\nArizona Wildcats hockey\nteam. Robert M. Tanita was a nationally ranked collegiate wrestler who reached the NCAA finals tournament as WAC champion in 1963.\n[\n151\n]\nThree national championships for\nsynchronized swimming\nwere won in 1980, 1981, and 1984, though these championships were in the\nAssociation of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women\n, and not the\nNCAA\n. Along with winning three national championships in the pool for synchronized swimming, the Wildcats have also won their first\nNCAA\nChampionship in men and women's swimming and diving for the seasons of 2007–2008. Topping off these weekends\nFrank Busch\n, the men and women's head coach, was named\nNCAA\nSwimming Coach of the Year. Arizona men became the first team to claim a first-time title since UCLA's win in 1982. Also, the men ended Texas and Auburn's winning streak since 1998. At the end of the meet, the\nTexas Longhorns\ntook second while 2007's champion, the\nAuburn Tigers\n, took fifth. For the women, Arizona worked on the disappointment of 2007's defeat. The women were winning until the last day when Auburn grasped the title. Unlike 2007, Arizona's women did not let anyone come close. The Wildcats won with 484 team points while the Auburn Tigers came in second with 348 and the\nStanford Cardinal\nin third with 343. Student-athletes from the women's swimming and diving team have been particularly heralded by the NCAA. The\nNCAA Woman of the Year Award\nwas won by UA swimmers Whitney Myers, Lacey Nymeyer and Justine Schluntz in 2007, 2009 and 2010 respectively. The three awards and the 1994 award won by track and field athlete Tanya Hughes are the highest number of Woman of the Year awards won by a single university.\n[\n152\n]\nIndividual national championships\n[\nedit\n]\nA number of notable individuals have also won national championships in the\nNCAA\n. Arizona's first NCAA Individual Champion in the sport of Men's Swimming came in 1981 when Doug Towne won the 500-yard freestyle at the NCAA championships. Another individual champion occurred in 1989 when Mariusz Podkoscielny won the 1650-yard (mile) at the NCAA National Championships held at the IUPUI Natatorium. Some other champion swimmers include\nCrissy Ahmann-Leighton\n,\nRyk Neethling\n,\nMargo Geer\n,\nKevin Cordes\n, and\nAmanda Beard\n.\nAnnika Sörenstam\nwon in 1991 in golf, and\nBrigetta Barrett\nwon the women's high jump in 2013. The men's\ncross country\nhas also produced two individual national titles in 1986 (Aaron Ramirez) and 1994 (Martin Keino) (\nNCAA Men's Cross Country Champions\n). The women's cross country also produced two individual national titles in 1996 (\nAmy Skieresz\n) and 2001 (Tara Chaplin) (\nNCAA Women's Cross Country Championship\n). Another notable individual was football standout\nVance Johnson\nwho won the NCAA long jump in 1982.\nRivalries\n[\nedit\n]\nA strong athletic rivalry exists between the University of Arizona and\nArizona State University\nin\nTempe\n, Arizona. The University of Arizona leads the all-time record against Arizona State University in men's basketball (149–83), as well as in football (49–42–1). The football rivalry game between the schools is known as \"The Duel in the Desert\". The trophy awarded after each game is the\nTerritorial Cup\n. Rivalries have also been created with other\nPac-12\nteams, especially the\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nwhich has proved to be a worthy\nsoftball\nrival and was Arizona's main basketball rival for most of 1990s.\nMascot\n[\nedit\n]\nWilma and Wilbur Wildcat at the 100th homecoming at the University of Arizona\nThe university's mascots are a pair of\nanthropomorphized\nwildcats\nnamed\nWilbur and Wilma\n. The human figures behind Wilbur and Wilma are kept secret through the year as the mascots appear only in costume. In 1986, Wilbur married his longtime wildcat girlfriend, Wilma. Together, Wilbur and Wilma appear along with the\ncheerleading\nsquad at most Wildcat sporting events.\n[\n153\n]\nArizona's first mascot was a real desert\nbobcat\nnamed \"Rufus Arizona\", introduced in 1915.\n[\n154\n]\nFight song\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nFight! Wildcats! Fight!\n\"Fight! Wildcats! Fight!\"\nis the official\nfight song\nof the UA. While \"\nBear Down, Arizona!\n\" is the more recognizable fight song attributed to the university, it was written 23 years after \"Fight!\" and is now described as the official motto of the\nArizona Wildcats\n.\n[\n155\n]\nIn 1952 Jack K. Lee, the new director of the UA's band, saw the words \"BEAR DOWN\" written on the university's gymnasium and was inspired to create the music and lyrics for a fight song by that name.\n[\n156\n]\nThe UA fans were delighted when the song was played during athletic events, and \"\nBear Down, Arizona!\n\" became accepted as the unofficial fight song.\n[\n156\n]\n[\n45\n]\nZonaZoo\n[\nedit\n]\nOfficially implemented in 2003, ZonaZoo is the official student section and student ticketing program for the University of Arizona Athletics. The ZonaZoo program is co-owned by the Associated Students of the University of Arizona (ASUA) and Arizona Athletics yet run by a team of individuals called the ZonaZoo Crew. In 2014, ESPN ranked ZonaZoo as the top student cheering section in the PAC 12 conference and in 2015, and in 2018, ZonaZoo received the Best Student Section of the Year award from the National Collegiate Student Section Association.\n[\n157\n]\nNotable alumni and staff\n[\nedit\n]\nFor a more comprehensive list, see\nList of University of Arizona people\n.\nNotable University of Arizona alumni, faculty, and staff include:\nJerry Bruckheimer\n, film and television producer\nNoam Chomsky\n, linguist and activist\nDennis DeConcini\n, former\nU.S. senator\nfrom Arizona\nBarry Goldwater\n, former U.S. senator from Arizona and\n1964\nU.S. presidential candidate\nNick Foles\n,\nSuper Bowl LII\nMost Valuable Player\nRob Gronkowski\n, four-time first-team\nAll-Pro\ntight end\nSavannah Guthrie\n, journalist and co-anchor of\nToday\nTrevor Hoffman\n,\nBaseball Hall Of Fame\ncloser\nAndre Iguodala\n,\n2015 NBA Finals\nMost Valuable Player\nWoody Johnson\n, businessman and former\nU.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom\nKourtney Kardashian\n, socialite and media personality\nSteve Kerr\n, former NBA point guard and coach of the\nGolden State Warriors\nJon Kyl\n, former\nSenate Minority Whip\nLinda McCartney\n, photographer and musician; wife of\nPaul McCartney\nCraig T.

The school is located on the\nPhiladelphia Main Line\n.\nHarriton is one of two high schools in the\nLower Merion School District\n, with the other being\nLower Merion High School\n.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nHarriton High School is situated on a portion of the plantation grounds belonging to\nCharles Thomson\n, son-in-law of Richard and Hannah Harrison, giving Harriton High School its name. Thomson was secretary (1774–1789) of the\nContinental Congresses\nas well as the\nConvention\nto debate and negotiate the\nConstitution of the United States\n.\nCharles Thomson\n(1729–1824), proprietor of\nHarriton House\nbuilt in 1740s and on whose lands Harriton High School is sited. Thomson was secretary (1774–1789) of the first and second\nContinental Congress\nas well as convention to debate and negotiate the\nConstitution of the United States\n. As secretary, Thomson, a\nFounding Father of the United States\n, prepared the\nJournals of the Continental Congress\n. Thomson is also known for co-designing the\nGreat Seal of the United States\nand adding its Latin mottoes\nAnnuit cœptis\nand\nNovus ordo seclorum\n.\nHarriton High School was designed in 1957 by architect\nVincent Kling\nand opened in 1958.\n[\n3\n]\nKling's design consisted of five buildings connected by covered walkways otherwise open to the elements, a style unusual for the region (and that it shared with\nWelsh Valley Middle School\n, built at the same time). Kling intended to create a modern design that encompassed a simple and effective layout with a focus on natural light and an airy environment. Ironically, Harriton's 1958 campus buildings surrounded a mostly concrete courtyard and was nicknamed \"the Tombs\" (despite the natural light and air).\nBy 2009, a new three-story building had replaced Kling's 1958 design, providing more sports and academic facilities to serve the growing student body.\n[\n4\n]\nClubs and activities\n[\nedit\n]\nScience Olympiad\n[\nedit\n]\nHarriton hosts a successful Science Olympiad chapter. The team has placed among the top 10 at the\nScience Olympiad\nNational Tournament for 21 consecutive years, winning three national championships and 16 consecutive state championships in that span.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n6\n]\nHarriton competes in the Southeastern Region for Regionals and Pennsylvania for States.\n[\n7\n]\nAlthough they have not run any invitationals in the past, Harriton participates in multiple invitationals, including Conestoga, Twin Tiers (Athens), Solon, Wright State,\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)\n,\nCornell\n,\nUPenn\nand\nPrinceton\n.\n[\n7\n]\nIn the states competition, Harriton held the longest winning streak of any Pennsylvanian team—athletic or not—placing first place at State for sixteen consecutive years (1997 to 2013). At the National competition, the team won the national title in 1995, 2001 and 2005.\nTeam Placements\nRegionals\nStates\nNationals\n2021\n2\n2\n16\n2019\n2\n1\n3\n2018\n1\n1\n3\n2017\n1\n1\n2\n2016\n2\n1\n2\n2015\n1\n1\n8\n2014\n2\n2\n3\n2013\n1\n1\n2\n2012\n1\n1\n6\n2011\n1\n1\n8\n2010\n2\n1\n8\nAcademic Decathlon\n[\nedit\n]\nHarriton High School features a chapter of the United States Academic Decathlon.

Members are divided into six committees: Students' Rights, Events, Communication, Finance, Planning, and Technology. There is a sub-committee under Students' Rights that was established after the district initiated the 1:1 laptop-to-student initiative (the Students' Rights Technology Sub-Committee).  Council is the organizing and executing body of the annual \"Mr. Harriton\" competition, one of the flagship productions at Harriton High School. \"Mr. Harriton\" is a competition between male students engaging in a \"beauty pageant\" style competition.

Of those, 75% attend 4 year universities and colleges and 24% 2 year colleges.\n[\n21\n]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nSchool shooting plans controversy\n[\nedit\n]\nIn February 2017, two 16-year-old boys were arrested on suspicion of plotting a shooting. Parents attending a Troy High School girls' soccer game the day before overheard three students discussing\nschool shootings\nand reported it to the School Resource Officer. The Fullerton Police Department investigated further and detained two of the three students. They reportedly \"served warrants at multiple locations in Anaheim\"\n[\n22\n]\nand found no weapons, but did discover internet research on “school shooting topics, including weaponry” from as soon as the day of the soccer game.\n[\n23\n]\nThe two boys were released from the Orange County Juvenile Hall later that day.\nThe boys described their plan as being “bigger than Columbine,” referencing the 1999\nColumbine High School massacre\n. The case has now been closed and both boys were found innocent. However, both of them were expelled from the district.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nStudent election rigged\n[\nedit\n]\nIn April 2012, junior Jacob Bigham discovered that\nASB\nfaculty advisor Jenny Redmond had altered the results of the student body election. Bigham had overheard the default computer password during a visit with a vice principal. He was placed on a 5-day suspension after exposing the scandal.  Bigham expressed discontent with Troy's dismissal of Redmond's wrongdoing: \"I feel changing the results of an election has far more gravity than finding out by whatever means that someone did that.\"\n[\n24\n]\nAsbestos incident\n[\nedit\n]\nIn one incident, five asbestos-containing bags were left near an intake for the ventilation system feeding the entire school. Numerous individuals at the school later reported respiratory symptoms, and over 80 faculty members at the school signed a petition to the district demanding full disclosure of the extent of exposure.\n[\n25\n]\nSchool and district officials still deny the existence of asbestos in the building, and refuse to disclose the full extent of the exposure.\n[\n26\n]\n[\n27\n]\n[\n28\n]\nPlane crash\n[\nedit\n]\nIn April 2002, a plane crashed into the Troy High School football field. Three were injured. Pilot Dale Ploung's airplane engine shut off and led to a crash. His passenger, David Cymbor, suffered minor injuries.\n[\n29\n]\nOracle\ncontroversy\n[\nedit\n]\nIn December 2004, Ann Long, at the time a Troy student and editor of the\nOracle\n, the school newspaper, wrote an\nOracle\narticle that profiled several openly\ngay\nstudents at the school.  The school administration initiated disciplinary action against the student, citing school and state education codes that prohibit asking students about their sexual orientation without parental notification. Long claimed she was forced to resign voluntarily or she would be fired from her position as student editor, even though the article had been approved by the newspaper's faculty advisor. Long was supported by the\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union\n, as well as the\nNational Center for Lesbian Rights\n, the Gay-Straight Alliance Network and the California Safe Schools Coalition.\n[\n30\n]\n[\n31\n]\n[\n32\n]\nRacial slurs by school administrators\n[\nedit\n]\nIn March 2010, an employee at Troy High School came forward with audio tapes that had been taped over a period of 18 months. The tapes contained evidence of racial slurs made by Troy High School administrators against other faculty members. After district officials conducted an investigation of the allegations, vice principals Janine Van Poppellin and Joseph D'Amelia as well as  Geno Rose were temporarily placed on unpaid leave. At the Fullerton Joint Unified School District board meeting on March 15, 2010, board members deliberated and the board eventually approved the \"release\" of the administrators in question, effective June 30, 2010. Geno Rose filed a lawsuit in 2010, and a settlement has since been reached out of court.\n[\n33\n]\nWrestling team hazing incident\n[\nedit\n]\nIn March 2012, eight students were suspended due to forcing nine fellow wrestlers to stand outside in the cold at 2:30 AM in a bucket of cold water and eat cat food. One student was stripped naked.\n[\n34\n]\nDead animals nailed to trees\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 1996, Fullerton police took a 17 year old student and suspected seven others of participating in an end of year prank involving beheading a kitten and nailing it to a tree along with a cat and a puppy. A possum was found disemboweled and thrown into the pool.\n[\n35\n]\n2002 Inappropriate relationship between teacher and student\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 2002, computer science teacher Craig Morgan Steele, 31, was charged in relation to an inappropriate sexual relationship in which he sodomized a former student.  The relationship was traced back to July and August 2001.\n[\n36\n]\n2017 Inappropriate relationship between teacher and student\n[\nedit\n]\nOn December 1, 2017, a Troy High School employee had witnessed wrestling coach Garrett Granger with a 16-year-old female student in an area of campus that raised suspicion. After a report was filed, thorough investigation revealed that Granger had been engaging in sexual relations with the student throughout the previous few weeks and was arrested for various sex crimes.\n[\n37\n]\n[\n38\n]\nShooting threat\n[\nedit\n]\nOn April 22, 2024, Troy High School was put on lockdown for an alleged threat of a school shooting.\n[\n39\n]\nBomb threat\n[\nedit\n]\nOn November 13, 2025, Troy High School (first school to receive the threat), along with three other Fullerton high schools and a medical center, were put on lockdown due to a bomb threat.

In addition, the university operates seven professional schools in the fields of\nbusiness\n,\nsocial work\n,\ntheology\n,\npublic policy\n,\nlaw\n,\nmedicine\n, and\nmolecular engineering\n, and a school of\ncontinuing studies\n. The university maintains satellite campuses and centers in London,\nHong Kong\n, Paris, Beijing, Delhi, Luxor, and downtown Chicago.\nUniversity of Chicago scholars have played a role in the development of many academic disciplines, including economics, law, literary criticism, mathematics, physics, religion, sociology, and political science, establishing the\nChicago schools\nof thought in various fields. The university's\nMetallurgical Laboratory\nproduced the world's first human-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction in\nChicago Pile-1\nbeneath the viewing stands of the university's\nStagg Field\n. Advances in chemistry led to the \"radiocarbon revolution\" in the\ncarbon-14 dating\nof ancient life and objects. The university research efforts include administration of the\nFermi National Accelerator Laboratory\nand the\nArgonne National Laboratory\n, as well as the\nMarine Biological Laboratory\n. The university is also home to the\nUniversity of Chicago Press\n, the largest\nuniversity press\nin North America.\nAs of 2025, the university's students, faculty, and staff have included\n101 Nobel laureates\n. The university's\nfaculty members and alumni\nalso include 10\nFields Medalists\n, 4\nTuring Award\nwinners, 58\nMacArthur Fellows\n, 30\nMarshall Scholars\n, 55\nRhodes Scholars\n, 27\nPulitzer Prize\nwinners, 20\nNational Humanities Medalists\n, and 6\nOlympic medalists\n.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nHistory of the University of Chicago\nOld University of Chicago\n[\nedit\n]\nFurther information:\nOld University of Chicago\nAlbert A.

Douglas\nand a fundraising campaign directed by the first president of the institution,\nJohn C. Burroughs\n.\n[\n4\n]\n: 8–10\nIt closed in 1886 after decades of financial struggle, exacerbated by the\nGreat Chicago Fire\nand the\nPanic of 1873\n,\n[\n4\n]\n: 18\nwhen the university's property was foreclosed on by its creditors.\n[\n4\n]\n: 8–10\nIn 1890, its trustees elected to change the university's name to the \"\nOld University of Chicago\n\" so that the new university could go by the name of the city; a year later, the new university voted to recognize the alumni of the old as alumni of the new.\n[\n4\n]\n: 59\nEarly years\n[\nedit\n]\nWikisource\nhas the text of a\n1911\nEncyclopædia Britannica\narticle about\nthe founding and early years\n.\nIn 1890, the\nAmerican Baptist Education Society\n(ABES) incorporated a new University of Chicago as a\ncoeducational\ninstitution,\n[\n5\n]\n: 137\nusing $400,000 donated to the ABES to supplement a $600,000 donation from\nStandard Oil\nco-founder\nJohn D. Rockefeller\n[\n6\n]\nand land donated by\nMarshall Field\n.\n[\n4\n]\n: 60–61\nThe\nHyde Park\ncampus’ construction was financed by donations from wealthy Chicagoans such as\nSilas B. Cobb\n, donor of the campus's first building, Cobb Lecture Hall;\n[\n7\n]\nCharles L. Hutchinson\n, trustee, treasurer and donor of\nHutchinson Commons\n;\n[\n8\n]\nand\nMartin A. Ryerson\n, president of the board of trustees and donor of the Ryerson Physical Laboratory.\n[\n4\n]\n: 103–105\nWilliam Rainey Harper\nbecame the university's president on July 1, 1891, and classes first began on October 1, 1892.\n[\n9\n]\nHarper offered large salaries to attract senior faculty,\n[\n4\n]\n: 78\nand in two years had a faculty of 120, including eight former university or college presidents.\n[\n10\n]\nThe undergraduate program was divided into two parts, with the first two years making up the Academic College, focusing on preparation for higher learning, and the last two years comprising the University College, with more advanced courses. The university operated on a\nquarter system\n, with 36 courses required to graduate.\n[\n4\n]\n: 82–84\nHarper brought the\nBaptist\nseminary, which had historical ties to the Old University of Chicago, to the university. This became the\nDivinity School\nin 1891, the first graduate professional school at the University of Chicago.\n[\n11\n]\n: 20–22\nHarper was a supporter of intercollegiate athletics, recruiting\nAmos Alonzo Stagg\nin 1892 to coach the football team and defending athletics from faculty opposition.\n[\n4\n]\n: 89\nIn 1894, the university adopted\nmaroon\nas its official color after initially selecting\ngoldenrod\n. The Maroons became the university's nickname during the same year.\n[\n12\n]\nDuring this period, the university founded the\nuniversity extension\n, which offered evening courses for adults and\ncorrespondence courses\n, and the\nUniversity of Chicago Press\n.\n[\n4\n]\n: 74\nRockefeller continued to provide significant contributions to the university after its founding. Harper's efforts to finance faculty research projects, expand the campus, and support university initiatives caused significant deficits covered by Rockefeller donations, with annual deficits between 1894 and 1903 averaging $215,000. In 1898, the board of trustees made a commitment to use new gifts to eliminate the deficit rather than to further expand programs, but structural deficits remained until after Harper's presidency.\n[\n4\n]\n: 110–112\n1906–1929\n[\nedit\n]\nAfter Harper's death in 1906, the board of trustees named\nHarry Pratt Judson\n, head of the Department of Political Science, acting president; in 1907, the appointment was made permanent.\n[\n4\n]\n: 149–150\nJudson initiated a policy of financial austerity, which renewed Rockefeller's confidence in the university and resulted in a series of large gifts to the endowment between 1906 and 1910, including a final gift of $10 million in 1910 that balanced the university's budget.\n[\n4\n]\n: 113\nIn 1911, the university adopted a Latin motto of\nCrescat scientia; vita excolatur\n, which translates to \"Let knowledge grow from more and more; and so be human life enriched.\"\n[\n13\n]\n[\n14\n]\nIn 1912, Judson successfully encouraged the board to create a faculty pension fund.\n[\n4\n]\n: 150\nDuring\nWorld War I\n, Judson, as well as faculty members such as\nAlbion Small\nand\nPaul Shorey\n, published works supporting the war. On the other hand, student reaction was mixed, with most not participating in newly formed voluntary military training programs such as the\nROTC\n. In 1918, the Student Army Training Corps program was announced by the War Department, which requisitioned the campus to be run by army officers for military training, but the\nNovember armistice\nsoon ended the program.\n[\n4\n]\n: 154–162\nAfter the war, the Oriental Institute, now the\nInstitute for the Study of Ancient Cultures\n, was founded by Egyptologist\nJames Henry Breasted\nto support and interpret\narcheological\nwork in what was then called the\nNear East\n.\n[\n15\n]\nIn 1923, senior scholar\nErnest D. Burton\nsucceeded Judson as president.\n[\n4\n]\n: 163–164\nBurton launched the first major fundraising campaign of the university to improve the research environment of the faculty as well as invest in residential halls for undergraduates, finding initial success despite faculty opposition to the perceived prioritization of undergraduate over graduate interests. Burton's sudden death in 1925 led to his replacement by physicist\nMax Mason\n, who ended the citywide fundraising drive early in favor of a quieter outreach among local businessmen.\n[\n4\n]\n: 167–182\nDuring Burton's term, and later Mason's, the\nChicago Schools\nof thought began to emerge in the social sciences, with new organizations being established such as the\nSocial Science Research Council\nin 1923.\n[\n4\n]\n: 190–191\n1929–1950\n[\nedit\n]\nSome of the University of Chicago team who worked on the production of the world's first human-caused self-sustaining nuclear reaction, including\nEnrico Fermi\nin the front row and\nLeó Szilárd\nin the second\nIn 1929, the 30-year-old dean of\nYale Law School\n,\nRobert Maynard Hutchins\n, became president.\n[\n4\n]\n: 167–182\nIn 1930, Hutchins organized the graduate departments under four independent divisions and united the undergraduate colleges into one college.\n[\n4\n]\n: 222\nIn 1931, alongside dean of the college\nChauncey Boucher\n, Hutchins implemented a new two-year general education curriculum called the \"New Plan\", which formed the basis for the university's core curriculum.\n[\n4\n]\n: 231–233\nLater in the 1930s, Hutchins became unsatisfied with departmental influence on the undergraduate curriculum and pushed for further expansion to the general education curriculum.\n[\n4\n]\n: 242–252\nIn 1942, Hutchins transferred jurisdiction of the BA degree from the graduate divisions to the college, thus removing divisional leverage to shape the curriculum. The same year, the college reformed the BA degree with four years of prescribed general education.\n[\n4\n]\n: 253–255\nBudget shortfalls caused by the Great Depression led to significant austerity measures and staffing cuts, though Hutchins protected the salaries of those who remained. In 1933, Hutchins proposed a plan to alleviate the financial situation by merging the university with\nNorthwestern University\n, though it was ultimately abandoned.\n[\n4\n]\n: 287–289\nFinancial woes contributed to the decision to end the university's football program in 1939.\n[\n4\n]\n: 214\nWith substantial budget gaps remaining and support from the\nRockefeller Foundation\nhaving dried up, a second major fundraising campaign was launched between 1939 and 1941 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the university's founding with mixed results.\n[\n4\n]\n: 290–299\nLarge deficits persisted after\nWorld War II\n, leaving future presidents to balance the budget.\n[\n4\n]\n: 316\nDuring the war, the university recruited a number of refugee scientists from Europe, including\nEnrico Fermi\n,\nRudolf Carnap\n, and\nJames Franck\n. The university's\nMetallurgical Laboratory\ncontributed to the\nManhattan Project\n, with Enrico Fermi engineering the first\nself-sustaining nuclear chain reaction\nunder the stands of\nStagg Field\n, the university's football stadium, in 1942.\n[\n16\n]\n[\n17\n]\n[\n4\n]\n: 301–305\nIn 1945, Hutchins announced the formation of the Institute for Nuclear Studies and the Institute for the Study of Metals in order to continue work done during the war. These were later renamed the\nEnrico Fermi Institute\nand the\nJames Franck Institute\n, respectively.\n[\n4\n]\n: 286\nThe university came under public scrutiny before and after the war for alleged communist influence, with university leadership called to testify before the\nIllinois General Assembly\non the loyalty of its student body and faculty in 1935 and 1949.\n[\n4\n]\n: 269–280\n1951–1977\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 1951, vice president of development\nLawrence Kimpton\nsucceeded Hutchins as chancellor,\n[\n4\n]\n: 323–324\na position created in 1945 replacing the president as head of the university.\n[\n4\n]\n: 310\nThe deficits left from Hutchins necessitated severe annual cuts in the operating budget, which was brought into balance by 1954. A fundraising campaign was launched the same year, which allowed for modest recovery,\n[\n4\n]\n: 338–343\nbut the financial situation worsened after a decline in undergraduate enrollments.\n[\n4\n]\n: 325–327\nIn 1957, to attract more students, Kimpton reduced the general education curriculum from four years to two years. Furthermore, the graduate divisional faculty with slowly merged with the previously independent college faculty via joint appointments.\n[\n4\n]\n: 328–330\nTo address safety concerns driven by increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood, the university became a major sponsor of a controversial\nurban renewal project for Hyde Park\n. Between 1954 and 1960, the university worked with the South East Chicago Commission and Mayor\nRichard J. Daley\nto clear approximately 925 acres of land, disproportionately affecting Black, low-income residents.\n[\n4\n]\n: 343–350\nFront page of\nChicago Maroon\nbreaking the news of the university's segregationist off-campus rental policies\nIn 1961,\nCaltech\nprofessor\nGeorge Beadle\nwas elected chancellor, resuming the title of president later that year.\n[\n18\n]\n[\n4\n]\n: 355–356\nBeadle's tenure saw large investments in faculty and campus expansion to rebuild the university after Kimpton's austerity, funded in large part by a $25 million grant provided by the\nFord Foundation\nand an accompanying fundraising campaign.\n[\n4\n]\n: 359–365\nThe university experienced its share of student unrest during this time, beginning in 1962 when then-freshman\nBernie Sanders\nhelped lead a\n15-day sit-in at the college's administration building\nin a protest over the university's segregationist off-campus rental policies. After continued turmoil, a university committee in 1967 issued what became known as the\nKalven Report\n. The report, a two-page statement of the university's policy in \"social and political action,\" declared that \"To perform its mission in the society, a university must sustain an extraordinary environment of freedom of inquiry and maintain an independence from political fashions, passions, and pressures.\"\n[\n19\n]\nIn 1964, the undergraduate college was reorganized into five collegiate divisions, four paralleling the four graduate divisions and one interdisciplinary New Collegiate Division.\n[\n4\n]\n: 366\nIn 1967, provost\nEdward Levi\nbecame president. His tenure saw a number of sit-ins at the administrative building: in 1962, over the university's segregationist off-campus rental policies;\n[\n20\n]\nin 1966 and 1967, over the university providing the class rank of students who sought deferments to draft boards; and in 1969, over the sociology's department decision not to rehire the openly Marxist assistant professor Marlene Dixon.\n[\n21\n]\n[\n4\n]\n: 371–375\nIn 1967, a university committee issued the\nKalven Report\n, maintaining the university's duty to uphold academic freedom and remain non-partisan.\n[\n4\n]\n: 497–499\nThe report has since been cited in university debates over divesting from South Africa and Sudan,\n[\n22\n]\nas well as in the\nChicago Principles\non free speech,\n[\n4\n]\n: 500\nwhich a number of other universities have since adopted.\n[\n23\n]\nBy the 1970s, facing the end of the Ford Foundation's support, a reduction in enrollment due to insufficient student housing, flagging federal funding, and broader economic\nstagflation\n, the university faced more fiscal austerity.\n[\n4\n]\n: 379–387\nIn 1975, provost John Wilson was appointed president, balancing the budget once more through cuts.\n[\n4\n]\n: 391–393\n1978–present\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 1978, history scholar and provost of\nYale\n,\nHanna Holborn Gray\n, became president of the university. She was the first woman in the United States to be appointed to a full-term presidency of a major research university.\n[\n4\n]\n: 393\nStill facing budgetary issues, Gray modernized the university's financial systems, increased the size and tuition of the undergraduate college, and paired campus expansion and renovation with administrative austerity. While budgetary equilibrium was reached through the mid-1980s, acute deficits soon re-emerged, exacerbated by the\n1990-1992 recession\n.\n[\n4\n]\n: 393–398\nGray also oversaw the implementation of a unified 21 course core curriculum across all collegiate divisions in 1985 and invested in student life through new food services, school festivals, and the reintroduction of varsity athletics.\n[\n4\n]\n: 403–405\nView from the\nMidway Plaisance\nIn 1992, economist\nHugo F. Sonnenschein\nbecame president, facing projected deficits of $23 million for the 1995-96 budget and poor endowment growth.\n[\n4\n]\n: 407\nThe raising of $676 million in a fundraising campaign for the university's centennial throughout the early 1990s helped alleviate these problems.\n[\n4\n]\n: 418\nIn 1996, Sonnenschein proposed the expansion of the undergraduate college by 1,000 students to raise tuition revenue, and in 1997, backed a plan to reduce the number of required course in the core curriculum from 21 to 15–18 (depending on how a student met the language requirement). After intense debate, with the university becoming the focal point of a national debate on education, both reforms were approved.\n[\n4\n]\n: 409–417\nIn 2000,\nCornell University\nprovost Don Michael Randel became the twelfth president of the university. His tenure was marked by increased support for the arts on campus, stronger outreach to local civic and business leaders, investments in major campus facilities, and the launch of a new $2 billion capital campaign.\n[\n4\n]\n: 421\nIn 2006, mathematician\nRobert J. Zimmer\nwas appointed president, receiving board approval to take on large amounts of debt at low interest rates after the\n2008 recession\nin order to finance a number of major projects.\n[\n4\n]\n: 465–468\nThese included new buildings and pavilions, such as\nMansueto Library\nin 2011, a reading room and book storage facility;\n[\n24\n]\nthe Logan Center for the Arts in 2012;\n[\n4\n]\n: 471\nthe Keller Center in 2019, home of the\nHarris School of Public Policy\n;\n[\n4\n]\n: 471\nand Woodlawn Residential Commons in 2020, which houses 1,298 students.\n[\n25\n]\nBetween 2008 and 2022, the university partnered with the city and outside businesses to launch three interventions along 53rd Street in an attempt to improve the neighborhood's economic condition.\n[\n4\n]\n: 473–477\nAs part of an effort to invest in its professional schools, the university formed the\nBecker Friedman Institute\nin 2011,\n[\n26\n]\nacquired the\nMarine Biological Laboratory\nin 2013,\n[\n4\n]\n: 491\nrepurposed the\nCrerar Library\nas the headquarters of the Department of Computer Science in 2018,\n[\n4\n]\n: 472\nand established the\nPritzker School of Molecular Engineering\nin 2019.\n[\n27\n]\nThe university also expanded its presence abroad, opening\ncampuses in Hong Kong\nin 2018,\n[\n28\n]\nin London in 2022,\n[\n4\n]\n: 507\nand in Paris in 2024,\n[\n29\n]\nalongside centers in Beijing in 2010\n[\n30\n]\nand in Delhi in 2014.\n[\n31\n]\nDespite a $5.4 billion fundraising campaign started in 2014,\n[\n4\n]\n: 468\nuniversity debt has exceeded initial planning expectations, reaching $6.3 billion in 2025.\n[\n32\n]\nIn 2021, Zimmer was succeeded by\nPaul Alivisatos\n, then-provost of the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n. In 2024, university students set up\nan encampment on the university's main quad\n[\n33\n]\nas a part of\nthe nationwide movement\nin support of Palestine at institutions of higher learning across the country. The encampment was later cleared by University of Chicago Police Department officers.\n[\n34\n]\nCampus\n[\nedit\n]\nMain campus\n[\nedit\n]\nThe campus of the University of Chicago, from the top of\nRockefeller Chapel\n.

The school is governed under the authority of the\nNew York State Education Department\n, whose\nstandardized examinations\nare designed and administered by the\nBoard of Regents\nof the\nUniversity of the State of New York\n.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nFayetteville–Manlius High School was opened in 1963 after the 1951 merger of then separate Fayetteville and Manlius school districts and subsequent need to consolidate students into a single high school. Upon this opening, a major school restructuring was implemented, as the Fayetteville High School became\nWellwood Middle School\nand Manlius High School became Pleasant Street Elementary (which closed in 1975). A new\nmiddle school\n,\nEagle Hill\n, was also opened directly next to the high school in 1965. Space requirements, due mainly to ballooning enrollment and continued reorganization as a result of the 1951 merger, prompted the district to relocate Eagle Hill to a new building on a new campus in 1972, so the high school could expand into the junior high's previous facilities. This expansion, which connected the two buildings, now called House 2 and House 1, by a hallway and an enclosed footbridge, nearly doubled the school's footprint. F-M High School served grades 12 through 10 until 1976, when the two junior high schools became middle schools, and FM High took in 9th graders.\n[\n2\n]\nAdministration\n[\nedit\n]\nFormer principal of Mott Road Elementary School and vice principal of Fayetteville–Manlius High School itself, Patrick McNamara was selected to replace interim principal John Durkee, himself replacing longtime principal Raymond W. Kilmer, III (now superintendent of\nOswego City School District\n), and legally began his reign on July 1, 2024.\n[\n3\n]\nTraditions\n[\nedit\n]\nMany of the school's traditions stem from the fact that decades ago, hornets nested in a 200-year-old oak tree that formerly stood on the old high school campus (now Wellwood Middle School).\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\nBecause of this, the athletic teams' mascots are the Hornets, and several of the names used for the school newspaper over the years have been hornet-related (see Extracurriculars, below).\nThe school\nalma mater\ngives tribute to the original tree in its opening\nstanza\n, \"Guarded by the old oak tree...\".  The alma mater is set to the melody of \"\nAura Lee\n\". Its lyrics are attributed to teacher Richard Rhoades \"and his music composition class\".\n[\n6\n]\nThe motif can also be seen in the school colors (green and white), in the district\nlogo\n, and in the name of the school yearbook (\nOakleaves\n).\nDemographics\n[\nedit\n]\nThere are currently 1,405 students\n[\n7\n]\nenrolled at F-M High School and 130 faculty members, for a student-teacher ratio of approximately 14:1.\nAs of the 2005–06 school year, the racial/ethnic makeup of the student population was 91.8%\nWhite\n, 2.7%\nBlack\nor\nAfrican American\n, 4.4%\nAsian\nor\nPacific Islander\n, and 0.8%\nHispanic\n. Approximately 0.5% of the population, or 8 students, demonstrated limited English proficiency. Approximately 0.8% of students qualified for a reduced-price lunch, and another 3.5% were eligible for a free lunch. Since then the Asian student population has increased significantly, and now makes up almost 10% of the school's population.\nAcademics and extracurriculars\n[\nedit\n]\nCurriculum\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section\nneeds additional citations for\nverification\n.\nPlease help\nimprove this article\nby\nadding citations to reliable sources\nin this section.

The\nRegents Diploma with Advanced Designation\nmay be achieved with extended studies in a foreign language.\nThough the curriculum is developed and sanctioned by the\nNew York State Department of Education\n, and classes are developed to prepare students to achieve success on the required\nRegents Examinations\n, most core courses offer one or two components that explore more advanced topics. The school offers standard level Regents courses, but also offers more advanced Honors courses, Interdisciplinary courses (in English and History),\nAdvanced Placement\n(AP) courses, as well as\nSyracuse University\ncourses offered through\nSyracuse University Project Advance\n(SUPA). SU courses offered through Project Advance are taught at the high school by F-M faculty members (qualified by the university), and follow the same curriculum and are given the same credit\n[\n8\n]\nas courses taught at the university. A large percentage of students opt to take SU courses offered through Project Advance instead of AP classes because their equally challenging curriculum is often more widely accepted for transfer credit by the students' successive colleges or universities.\nF-M is part of an extremely small percentage in the country that does not rank students publicly with the exception of awarding\nvaledictorian\nto a graduating senior. The school also uses a 100\ngrade point\nscale, as opposed to the much more common 4.0 scale, and weighs the GPA based on class difficulty level (Regents, Honors, AP, etc.). In addition, the athletic department does not participate in academic\nAll-America\nhonors.\nNotable achievements\n[\nedit\n]\nScience Olympiad National Champions in 2004\nOther National Finishes: 3rd Place: 2005. 4th Place: 2000,\n[\n9\n]\n2001, 2006,\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\n2007,\n[\n12\n]\n5th Place: 2009\n[\n13\n]\nNew York State Championships in ten consecutive years 2003–2012, 2014, and 2018.\n[\n14\n]\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\n2005 gold medal and 2006 blue ribbon,\nExpansion Management\nmagazine's Education Quotient\n[\n17\n]\n1999, 2000, and 2006 GRAMMY Signature School\n[\n18\n]\nSix-times named one of the American Music Conference's \"Best 100 Communities for Music Education in America\".\n[\n19\n]\nThe high school is consistently honored by the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards as having one of the best art programs in the country.\n[\n20\n]\nIn 2006, students from the high school received a record number of national awards, including the prestigious National American Vision Award.\n[\n21\n]\nThe district consistently exceeds average state and national performances on the\nSAT\n. In addition, 99% of F-M students take the exam at least once.\n[\n22\n]\nThe average scores for the Class of 2010 are as follows:\nF-M\n[\n23\n]\nState\n[\n24\n]\nNation\n[\n25\n]\nCritical Reading\n565\n484\n501\nMath\n593\n499\n516\nWriting\n560\n478\n492\nTOTAL\n1718\n1461\n1509\nGraduation data\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 2006, the school graduated 100% of its\nsenior\nclass, 69% of whom received a\nRegents Diploma with Advanced Designation\n, and 28% of whom received a\nRegents Diploma\n. Of these graduating students, 98% continued on to\nhigher education\n, 84% to a four-year college, and 14% to a two-year college. Of the remaining graduates, 1% continued into the\nworkforce\n, and another 1% had unknown plans. The dropout rate also remained under 1%, about half of whom enrolled in a High School Equivalency or\nGED\nprogram.\n[\n26\n]\nExtracurriculars\n[\nedit\n]\nThe student activities program offers more than fifty clubs and activities in a wide range of interests.  Student-run publications include the\nOakleaves\nyearbook, the student newspaper called\nThe Buzz\n(formerly\nThe Sting\n, formerly the\nHornet's Nest\n), and a literary magazine,\nVoices\n.\nThe school has a Quizbowl team (which has appeared in International Academic Competitions' National History Bowl in\nCrystal City, Virginia\n) and Amnesty International Club. Fayetteville-Manlius also boasts a Model United Nations club with more than a hundred participants. The club hosts an annual Central New York MUN Conference (CNYMUN), often inviting over a thousand delegates from around New York.  Another extracurricular area in which the Hornets excel is Mock Trial, where in 2016, Fayetteville–Manlius High School won the New York State Mock Trial Championship with an undefeated season record.\n[\n27\n]\nIn 2020, they placed third in the same competition.\nThe school has a chamber orchestra, string orchestra, concert orchestra, symphony orchestra, jazz ensemble, two bands, concert band, and wind ensemble as well as a very powerful Pep Band, and three vocal groups: choir, the select group's chorale, and Swing 16. The school also has the top Ukulele Ensemble in the Central New York area.\n[\n28\n]\nFM also has three major stage productions during the year. The final production of the year, called\nShowboat\n, is the annual student-run talent show, a tradition reaching back several decades. Fayetteville–Manlius High School also hosts a π memorization contest, which along with other events, culminates in an annual assembly called \"pi day\", which typically takes place on March 14 (the date signifies the first three digits of pi.) The assembly includes song performances as well as competitions.\n[\n29\n]\nAthletics\n[\nedit\n]\nF-M's 32\nvarsity\nteams compete in the Metro Division of the SCAC, Section III of the\nNew York State Public High School Athletic Association\n(NYSPHSAA),\n[\n30\n]\nand Section III of the New York State Scholastic Rowing Association.\n[\n31\n]\nThe teams include:\nFayetteville-Manlius sports teams\nSeason:\nGirls:\nBoys:\nFall\ncheerleading\n,\ncross country\n,\nfield hockey\n,\ngymnastics\n,\nsoccer\n,\nswimming\n,\ntennis\n,\nvolleyball\ncross country\n,\nfootball\n,\ngolf\n,\nsoccer\n,\nvolleyball\n,\ncheerleading\nWinter\nbasketball\n,\nbowling\n,\ncheerleading\n,\nindoor track\nbasketball\n,\nbowling\n,\nice hockey\n,\nindoor track\n,\nswimming\n,\nwrestling\n,\ncheerleading\nSpring\ncrew\n,\ngolf\n,\nlacrosse\n,\nsoftball\n,\ntrack\nbaseball\n,\ncrew\n,\nlacrosse\n,\ntennis\n,\ntrack\nThe Hornet, F-M's school\nmascot\n, a recolored version of\nGeorgia Tech\n's mascot,\nBuzz\n.

Lowest spending=1; Highest=103\nThe\nWest Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District\nis a comprehensive high achieving regional\npublic\nschool district\nin the\nU.S. state\nof\nNew Jersey\n, serving students in\npre-kindergarten\nthrough\ntwelfth grade\nfrom\nWest Windsor Township\n(in\nMercer County\n) and\nPlainsboro Township\n(in\nMiddlesex County\n).\n[\n3\n]\nThere are four elementary schools (grades PreK/K - 3), two upper elementary schools (grades 4 and 5), two middle schools (grades 6 - 8) and two high schools (grades 9 - 12).\n[\n4\n]\nNiche.com\nlisted the district as fifth best in New Jersey, and 73rd best in the nation, according to its 2025 Best Schools ranking.\n[\n5\n]\nAs of the 2020–21 school year, the district, comprising 10 schools, had an enrollment of 9,386 students and 773.2 classroom teachers (on an\nFTE\nbasis), for a\nstudent–teacher ratio\nof 12.1:1.\n[\n1\n]\nThe district is classified by the\nNew Jersey Department of Education\nas being in\nDistrict Factor Group\n\"J\", the highest of eight groupings. District Factor Groups organize districts statewide to allow comparison by common\nsocioeconomic\ncharacteristics of the local districts. From lowest socioeconomic status to highest, the categories are A, B, CD, DE, FG, GH, I and J.\n[\n6\n]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThe West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District was the result of the 1969 merger of two separate, neighboring school districts - the Plainsboro School District and the West Windsor School District - as the population of both municipalities was starting to grow rapidly. The districts merged so that they could accommodate the increasing number of students newly enrolling.\n[\n7\n]\nDutch Neck and Wicoff elementary schools were constructed well before the establishment of the regional district.\n[\n8\n]\nConstructed at a cost of $8 million (equivalent to $58 million in 2025) and designed to ultimately accommodate an enrollment of 1,300 students in grades 7-12, West Windsor-Plainsboro High School (since renamed as\nWest Windsor-Plainsboro High School South\n) opened in 1973 for grades 7-10, with students in grades 11 and 12 completing their education at\nPrinceton High School\n.\n[\n9\n]\nWith a decline in the number of student-athletes playing football at WW-P North that would be inadequate for the school to field a team of its own, the district attempted to combine the teams from the two schools to have them operate as a single cooperative football team for the 2017-18 school year based at South HS. Given that the size of the schools is larger than the threshold established by the state for co-op programs (North is classified as Group III and South as Group IV, based on the size of the enrollment of each school), the proposal was rejected by the\nWest Jersey Football League\nand by the Leagues and Conferences Committee of the\nNew Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association\n, before an appeal of the decision was rejected by the commissioner of the\nNew Jersey Department of Education\n.\n[\n10\n]\nIn August 2017,\n[\n11\n]\nthe district announced that WW-P North would cancel its program. The members of the canceled program will be eligible to play for the North junior varsity football team, but will not be able to play for the South team.\n[\n12\n]\nAwards and recognition\n[\nedit\n]\nThe West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District is one of the top achieving districts in New Jersey. The high schools have held first to fifth places in many of the state's rankings. In 2004,\nWest Windsor-Plainsboro High School North\nwas ranked #1 in the state of New Jersey by\nNew Jersey Monthly\nmagazine and\nWest Windsor-Plainsboro High School South\nwas ranked #5. West Windsor-Plainsboro High School South was the 9th ranked public high school, and North was 18th-ranked, in New Jersey out of 316 schools statewide, in\nNew Jersey Monthly\nmagazine's September 2006 cover story on the state's\nTop Public High Schools\n.\n[\n13\n]\nWest Windsor-Plainsboro High School South\nwas recognized during the 1992-93 school year, and Maurice Hawk Elementary School was recognized during the 1993-94 school year, with the\nNational Blue Ribbon Award of Excellence\nfrom the\nUnited States Department of Education\n, the highest honor that an American school can achieve.\n[\n14\n]\nWest Windsor-Plainsboro High School North\nwas recognized in the 2006-07 school year with the Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the U.S. Department of Education,\n[\n15\n]\nthe highest award an American school can receive.\n[\n16\n]\n[\n17\n]\nIn both the 2004–05 and 2006-07 school years, the Community Middle School\nScience Olympiad\nteam was first in the country.\n[\n18\n]\nStarting in the 2001-2002 school years, they were also the Science Olympiad state and regional champions for every subsequent year. However, Thomas R. Grover Middle School defeated Community Middle School in the 2019-2020 States competition but did not compete in Nationals due to\nCOVID-19\ncancellations.\nThe West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District supports\nFIRST Robotics Competition\nTeam #1923,\nThe MidKnight Inventors\n, which welcomes students from both high schools. The team has been competing since 2006, and mentors FIRST programs across all grade levels in the district, as well as internationally. The team has won four regional competitions including, 2009 New Jersey Regional, 2011 Connecticut Regional, 2017 Mount Olive District, and 2017 Montgomery District. They have been recognized with various awards for community outreach & spreading the mission of FIRST, and has received individual recognitions for both students and mentors on the team's leadership & effective communication within the scope of the FIRST Robotics Competition. The MidKnight Inventors, Team #1923, has made it to the\nFIRST Championships\nsix years (2009, 2011, 2013, 2015-2017) since 2006 when they first began competing. In 2015, at the FIRST Championship in St. Louis, Missouri, The MidKnight Inventors finished 3rd, out of the 3,000 teams that competed in the FRC competition.\n[\n19\n]\nControversy\n[\nedit\n]\nWest Windsor-Plainsboro is notable for its ongoing divide over the school district's academics. The controversy comes amidst Superintendent of Schools David Aderhold's plan to ease the high school curriculum. The plan consisted of the elimination of midterm and final exams, increasing the number of no homework nights, and the removal of the A&E math program for the 4th and 5th grades. According to a Christmas-day New York Times article by author Kyle Spencer, the divide appears to be somewhat racial, as the area has a high Asian-American population, such as Indian, Pakistani, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean students. Some parents have argued that such change hinders the overall academic experience. Other parents believe the children are stressed out to an unhealthy degree. It has been argued that placing too much stress on academics with the intent of going to a good college is wrong, as colleges are more interested in projects and student-led activities than grades alone. The high schools within the West Windsor-Plainsboro School District have been outlined as prep or pre-college institutions, rather than as public high schools. Some have noted that the Asian parents (many first-generation immigrants) are simply trying to boost their children into the middle class. However, there were many that do not fall along the racial divide.\n[\n20\n]\nAn ongoing, parallel controversy in the district has consisted of students, teachers, and alumni who allege that the administrators and parents of the district overemphasize funding for and teaching of\nSTEM\nat the expense of the\nhumanities\n,\narts\n, and sometimes languages. Attempts to cut language programs, including\nGerman\nand\nLatin\n, have ignited controversy and led to allegations that the school district under-prepares students to study non-STEM fields or to work outside of the United States.\n[\n21\n]\nA controversy regarding youth sports took place in September of the 2020-2021 school year. Parent and student advocates of youth sports fought for Superintendent David Aderhold to reverse the cancellation of fall sports. The advocates alleged that the cancellation of fall sports negatively impacted the mental health of student-athletes, exacerbated by the COVID-19 Pandemic. The advocates were met with resistance by the Administration and community members who prioritized the well-being of the community during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n[\n22\n]\nSchools\n[\nedit\n]\nSchools in the district (with 2020–21 enrollment data from the\nNational Center for Education Statistics\n[\n23\n]\n) are:\n[\n24\n]\n[\n25\n]\n[\n26\n]\n[\n27\n]\nLower elementary schools\nDutch Neck Elementary School\n[\n28\n]\n(located in West Windsor: 704 students; in grades K-3)\nDavid Argese, principal\nMaurice Hawk Elementary School\n[\n29\n]\n(West Windsor: 723; K-3)\nSara Bright, principal\nTown Center Elementary School\n[\n30\n]\n(Plainsboro: 431; PreK-2)\nErin Falk, principal\nJ.V.B.

It merged with Georgia Health Sciences University in 2012 to form Georgia Regents University, later known as\nAugusta University\n.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nAugusta State University was founded as a high school named\nAcademy of Richmond County\nin 1783. It opened in 1785 and offered collegiate-level classes from its earliest days, and its classes were overseen by the\nGeorgia state legislature\n.  Graduates were accepted into colleges as sophomores or juniors.  Operation of the academy was overseen by a board of trustees until 1909, when control was passed to the Augusta Board of Education. The college-level classes continued to be overseen by a committee of the state legislature.  As\nenrollment\nincreased, land for a new building was purchased. In 1925, prior to completion of the new building, the\nJunior College of Augusta\nwas established. In 1957, the junior college separated from the academy and moved to its present location on Walton Way.\nIn 1958, the college became a part of the University System of Georgia and its name was formally changed to\nAugusta College\n.  It remained a\ntwo-year college\nuntil 1963, when it attained four-year status.  A second campus was added on\nWrightsboro Road\n, which now houses athletics,\nkinesiology\n& health science, a golf house, and 18-hole\ngolf course\n.\nIn 1996, Augusta College was renamed Augusta State University, along with name changes mandated for most of the rest of the university system.\nOn June 30, 2012, William A. Bloodworth Jr. retired as president of Augusta State University and was replaced the next day by interim president\nShirley Strum Kenny\nwho occupied the office until August 10, 2012, when the office was abolished upon the university's merger.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\nOn August 10, 2012, the\nBoard of Regents\nof the\nUniversity System of Georgia\napproved the merger of the school by\nfall\n2013 with nearby Georgia Health Sciences University.\nRicardo Azziz\ntook the helm of ASU in summer of 2012 in preparation for the oncoming consolidation. The board named the new university\nGeorgia Regents University\n, which caused considerable local controversy.\n[\n4\n]\nIt also triggered a lawsuit for alleged\ntrademark infringement\nby\nRegent University\nin Virginia, which was settled out of court in June 2013.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n6\n]\nOn September 15, 2015, Georgia Regents University voted and changed the name to \"Augusta University\". This change came from years of frustration from alumni and decreased fundraising brought in following the name change to GRU. \"Augusta University\" was one of the top choices during the original name change from Augusta State to GRU.\nAcademics\n[\nedit\n]\nAugusta State was organized into six undergraduate colleges: Katherine Reese Pamplin College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences,\nJames M. Hull College of Business\n, the College of Education, the College of Allied Health Sciences, the College of Science and Mathematics, and the College of Nursing. Students could earn associate, bachelor, master, and specialist degrees in over 100 programs of study, and the college also offered paralegal certificates and cooperative doctorates. There was an Honors Program as well as a Cooperative Education program in which students alternated between classroom enrollment and work experience in their field of study. Students also had opportunities for internships and study abroad programs.\nThe James M. Hull College of Business was featured by The Princeton Review in the 2008 edition of, \"Best 290 Business Schools.\"\n[\n7\n]\nIn May 2009 the university hosted the 25th annual National\nScience Olympiad\ntournament.\nAthletics\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nAugusta Jaguars\nAugusta State's athletic programs competed at the\nDivision II\nlevel in the\nPeach Belt Conference\nof the\nNCAA\n, except for the men's and women's golf programs, both of which were\nDivision I\nIndependents.\nThe Jaguars' men's golf team won its first\nnational title\nin\n2010\n, knocking off perennial power\nOklahoma State\nin the championship match at The Honors Course in\nOoltewah, Tennessee\n. They defended their title in\n2011\nat Oklahoma State's home course,\nKarsten Creek\n, defeating the top-ranked Cowboys in the national semifinals and then\nGeorgia\nin the final round of match play to reclaim the championship. The Jaguars became the first men's golf team to win consecutive national titles since\nHouston\nin 1984–85. They won five\nBig South Conference\nchampionships: 1985, 1986, 1987, 1990, 1991 under coach Ernie Lanford.\nAugusta State's men's basketball program reached the Division II Elite Eight in\nSpringfield, MA\nthree consecutive years from 2008 to 2010, advancing as far as the national title game in '08. Through the end of the 2010–2011 season, ASU had been nationally ranked for 65 consecutive weeks, the fifth-longest streak in the history of Division II basketball.\n[\n8\n]\nAugusta State's men's tennis program reached the NCAA Championships for the first time in Louisville, Kentucky, in 2012. The program made the Final Four in what was the most successful year in the tennis program of the Jaguars.\n[\n9\n]\nAlso, Bernardo Fernandes landed the National honors in singles.\n[\n10\n]\nOther athletic programs at ASU included women's basketball, baseball, softball, men's and women's cross country, men's and women's tennis and volleyball.\nCampus\n[\nedit\n]\nBenet House\nPayne Hall (former\nAugusta Arsenal\nbuilding)\nReese Library\n[\nedit\n]\nReese Library, the information center of Augusta State, held a collection of more than 503,000 print and online books, plus an extensive collection of government publications, special collections and archives of materials relating to Georgia Regents and the greater Augusta area, over 500 print periodicals and more than 30,000 online journal titles. Thousands of journals, newspaper articles and books also were available in electronic full-text through GALILEO, an initiative of the University System of Georgia.\nThere were quiet study areas for individuals and groups, casual seating areas and study rooms, a family room for students with children, wireless connectivity to the Internet, photocopiers, microfilm copiers, laptops available to borrow, and more than 50 public computers providing access to online databases and full-text information.\nGIL, the library's computerized catalog, provided access to information about library materials and other university system libraries.  GALILEO, a statewide computer system, provided a wealth of additional information resources including more than 200 journal and newspaper databases, some with full text.  These and other electronic information resources were available in the library, on the campus computer network, and, in most cases from off-campus computers with a password.  Materials from other libraries could be obtained through inter library loan via the University System of Georgia Universal Catalog's GIL Express for books and via ILLIAD for books and journal articles, with the option of having journal articles delivered directly to campus email accounts.\nThe building is named for Dr. and Mrs. John T. Reese, parents of alumna Katherine Reese Pamplin. The three-story 80,000-square-foot (7,400 m\n2\n) library has a\nseating capacity\nof just over 500. The library, now part of Georgia Regents University, is open 85.5 hours a week when classes are in session, with breaks in the academic schedule.\nOther buildings\n[\nedit\n]\nAllgood Hall\nThe early 21st century saw substantial development of the campus, with about $100 million worth of new construction. Some of the new buildings included the Science Building (completed in 1997), Allgood Hall (2002), University Hall (2004), the Jaguar Student Activities Center (commonly known as \"The JSAC\"; 2006), and the D. Douglas Bernard Jr. Amphitheatre (2008).  Other existing structures on campus are Washington Hall, named for\nJustine Wilkinson Washington\nand Isaiah E. Washington, which houses the art department and gallery as well as bookstore and some business offices, the fine arts building, the Maxwell Theatre, and Galloway Hall, which houses Military Science and Continuing Education. Historic Arsenal Buildings (Rains, Benet, Payne, and Fanning) house administrative offices. Bellevue Hall houses the dean of students and academic affair. Boykin Wright Hall houses Counseling and the Career Center. ASU also has the Maxwell Alumni Houses, and a Guardhouse History Museum. The\nChristenberry Fieldhouse\nhouses athletics and Kinesiology and Health Science.\nArsenal Oak\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Arsenal Oak in 2004\nThe Arsenal Oak was a\nWhite oak\ntree located at the center of the campus. The oak tree, which was estimated to be over 250 years old, formed the basis of the university's logo. It bore the name, Arsenal Oak, because the university's campus was once the\nAugusta Arsenal\n. It is said that the poet\nStephen Vincent Benét\n(the author of \"\nJohn Brown's Body\n\" and \"\nThe Devil and Daniel Webster\n\" sat beneath the branches of the Arsenal Oak as a boy as he wrote his poetry.  His father Colonel J. Walker Benét was stationed at the arsenal. Despite a decade long effort to save the Arsenal Oak from wood borers and\nhypoxylon canker\n, the diseased tree was removed in July 2004.\nIn March 2016, a new Arsenal Oak was planted; the new tree was grown using acorns from the original Arsenal Oak.\n[\n11\n]\nNotable alumni\n[\nedit\n]\nName\nClass year\nNotability\nReference(s)\nDoug Barnard Jr.\nUnited States\ncongressman\nfrom\nGeorgia\nJoelle Carter\nActress\nChen Be-yue\n1989\nJustice\nof the\nConstitutional Court\nof the\nRepublic of China\n[\n12\n]\nTommy Greer\nProfessional basketball player\nGreg Hire\n2010\nProfessional basketball player\nBen Madgen\n2010\nProfessional basketball player\nHenrik Norlander\nProfessional golfer\nPatrick Reed\n2011\nProfessional golfer\nBen Purser\nProfessional basketball player\n[\n13\n]\nGarret Siler\n2009\nProfessional basketball player\nEd Tarver\n1981\nUnited States Attorney\nVaughn Taylor\nProfessional golfer\nOliver Wilson\nProfessional golfer\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nState of Georgia portal\nStephen Vincent Benet House\nSummerville (Augusta, Georgia)\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\na\nb\nc\n\"Semester Enrollment Report\"\n(PDF)\n.\nOffice of Research and Policy Analysis\n.\nUniversity System of Georgia\n. 2007-11-12.

However, this body (the predecessor of the UW\nboard of regents\n) never actually accomplished anything before\nWisconsin\nwas incorporated as a state in 1848.\n[\n11\n]\nThe\nWisconsin Constitution\nprovided for \"the establishment of a state university, at or near the seat of state government...\" and directed by the state legislature to be governed by a\nboard of regents\nand administered by a\nchancellor\n. On July 26, 1848,\nNelson Dewey\n, Wisconsin's first\ngovernor\n, signed the act that formally created the University of Wisconsin.\n[\n12\n]\nJohn H. Lathrop\nbecame the university's first chancellor, in the fall of 1849.\n[\n13\n]\nWith\nJohn W. Sterling\nas the university's first professor (mathematics), the first class of 17 students met at\nMadison Female Academy\non February 5, 1849.\nA permanent campus site was soon selected: an area of 50 acres (20.2 ha) \"bounded north by Fourth lake, east by a street to be opened at right angles with King street\", [later State Street] \"south by Mineral Point Road (University Avenue), and west by a carriage-way from said road to the lake.\" The regents' building plans called for a \"main edifice fronting towards the Capitol, three stories high, surmounted by an observatory for astronomical observations.\"\n[\n14\n]\nThis building, University Hall, now known as\nBascom Hall\n, was finally completed in 1859.

The Wisconsin Idea permeates the university's work and helps forge close working relationships among university faculty and students, and the state's industries and government.\n[\n25\n]\nBased in Wisconsin's populist history, the Wisconsin Idea continues to inspire the work of the faculty, staff, and students who aim to solve real-world problems by working together across disciplines and demographics.\n[\n26\n]\nDuring this period, numerous significant research milestones were met, including the discoveries of\nVitamin A\nand\nVitamin B\nin 1913 and 1916, respectively, by\nElmer V. McCollum\nand\nMarguerite Davis\n, as well as the \"\nSingle-grain experiment\n\" conducted by\nStephen Moulton Babcock\nand\nEdwin B. Hart\nfrom 1907 to 1911, paving the way for modern nutrition as a science.\n[\n12\n]\nIn 1923,\nHarry Steenbock\ninvented a process for adding\nvitamin D\nto\nmilk\nand other foods, and in 1925, the\nWisconsin Alumni Research Foundation\nwas chartered to control patenting and patent income on UW–Madison inventions.\n[\n12\n]\nThe UW Graduate School had been separated in 1904-1905.\n[\n12\n]\nIn 1909,\nWilliam Purdy\nand Paul Beck wrote\nOn, Wisconsin\n, the UW–Madison athletic fight song.\n[\n27\n]\nRadio station 9XM, the oldest continually operating radio station in the United States, was founded on campus in 1919 (now\nWHA\n(970 AM).\n[\n12\n]\nThe\nMemorial Union\nopened in 1928, and the\nUniversity of Wisconsin–Madison Arboretum\nopened in 1934.\nStudents of the\nExperimental College\n, 1930\nThe\nUniversity of Wisconsin Experimental College\nwas a two-year college designed and led by\nAlexander Meiklejohn\nin 1927 with a\ngreat books\n,\nliberal arts\ncurriculum. Students followed a uniform curriculum that sought to teach democracy and foster an intrinsic love of learning, but the college developed a reputation for radicalism and wanton anarchy in which students lived and worked with their teachers, had no fixed schedule, no compulsory lessons, and no semesterly grades. The advisers taught primarily through\ntutorial\ninstead of lectures. The\nGreat Depression\nand lack of outreach to Wisconsinites and UW faculty led to the college's closure in 1932.\n[\n28\n]\nIn 1936, UW–Madison began an\nartist-in-residence\nprogram with\nJohn Steuart Curry\n, the first ever at a university.\n[\n12\n]\nIn the 1940s,\nWarfarin\n(Coumadin) was developed at UW by the laboratory of\nKarl Paul Link\nand named after the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.\n[\n29\n]\nDuring World War II, the University of Wisconsin was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the\nV-12 Navy College Training Program\nwhich offered students a path to a Navy commission.\n[\n30\n]\nLate 20th century to present\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nUniversity of Wisconsin System\nand\nSterling Hall bombing\nBascom Hill with crosses placed by students protesting the\nVietnam War\nand sign reading, \"Bascom Memorial Cemetery, Class of 1968\"\nOver time, additional campuses were added to the university.

Ten freshman-sophomore centers were also added to this system.\n[\n31\n]\nIn 1971, Wisconsin legislators passed a law merging the University of Wisconsin with the nine universities and four freshman-sophomore branch campuses of the\nWisconsin State Universities System\n, creating the University of Wisconsin System and bringing the two higher education systems under a single board of regents.\nUW–Madison's\nHoward Temin\n, a virologist, co-discovered the enzyme\nreverse transcriptase\nin 1969,\n[\n32\n]\nand\nThe Badger Herald\nwas founded as a conservative student paper the same year.\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, UW–Madison was shaken by a series of student protests, and by the use of force by authorities in response, comprehensively documented in the film\nThe War at Home\n. The first major demonstrations protested the presence on campus of\nrecruiters\nfor the\nDow Chemical\nCompany, which supplied the\nnapalm\nused in the\nVietnam War\n. Authorities used force to quell the disturbance. The struggle was documented in the book,\nThey Marched into Sunlight\n,\n[\n33\n]\nas well as the PBS documentary\nTwo Days in October\n.\n[\n34\n]\nAmong the students injured in the protest was former Madison mayor\nPaul Soglin\n.\nAnother target of protest was the Army Mathematics Research Center (AMRC) in Sterling Hall, which was also home of the physics department. The student newspaper,\nThe Daily Cardinal\n, published a series of investigative articles stating that AMRC was pursuing research directly pursuant to\nUS Department of Defense\nrequests, and supportive of military operations in Vietnam. AMRC became a magnet for demonstrations, in which protesters chanted \"U.S. out of Vietnam! Smash Army Math!\" On August 24, 1970, near 3:40 am, a bomb exploded next to Sterling Hall, aimed at destroying the Army Math Research Center.\n[\n35\n]\nDespite the late hour, a\npost doctoral physics researcher\n,\nRobert Fassnacht\n, was in the lab and was killed in the explosion.

The campus contains four\nNational Historic Landmarks\n.\n[\n37\n]\nThe central campus is on an urban layout mostly coinciding with the city of Madison's street grid, exceptions being the suburban\nUniversity of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics\n, and the Department of Psychiatry & Clinics in the West Side research park. It is approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the\nWisconsin State Capitol\n, connected by\nState Street\n.

The structure has been added to several times over the years. The building currently houses the office of the\nchancellor\nand vice chancellors. Bascom Hall is listed on the\nNational Register of Historic Places\nas a contributing building within the Bascom Hill Historic District.\n[\n45\n]\nFlanking both sides of Bascom Hall are the two oldest surviving buildings on campus. Designed by\nJohn F.

Its opposite twin, South Hall (built in 1855), originally served as the women's dormitory prior to the establishment of the Female College Building in 1871 (today the location of Chadbourne Hall).\n[\n47\n]\nThe administrative offices of the College of Letters and Science now occupy the building.\nEvening view of the Carillon Tower\nThe Carillon Tower, erected in 1936, was designed by\nWarren Powers Laird\nand\nPaul Philippe Cret\nso that the\nbalustrade\nechoes that on Bascom Hall.\n[\n48\n]\nThe carillon has 56 bronze bells, with the largest weighing 6,800 pounds.\n[\n49\n]\nAn automated system rings bells on the hour, playing songs such as \"\nVarsity\n\" and \"\nOn, Wisconsin!\n\". East of the tower lies a monument to the\nSauk\nleader\nBlack Hawk\n, whose flight through the Madison area represented the last armed conflict between the\nUnited States Army\nand native peoples in southern Wisconsin.\n[\n50\n]\nSeveral other notable architectural styles are represented in the historic core of the university. Following the 1884 fire that destroyed the original,\nMilwaukee\narchitect\nHenry C. Koch\ndesigned the new\nScience Hall\n(built in 1888) in a\nRomanesque Revival style\n.\n[\n51\n]\nThe Education Building, originally designed to house the College of Engineering, features a\nBeaux-Arts style\n.\n[\n52\n]\nStructures built in a\nNeoclassical style\ninclude Birge Hall and the\nWisconsin Historical Society\n.\n[\n53\n]\nLocated at the foot of the hill, Music Hall was designed in 1878 by Madison architect\nDavid R.

At 241 feet and 19 stories, Van Hise is the second-tallest building in Madison and one of the\ntallest educational buildings\nin the world.\n[\n55\n]\nBecause of its placement atop Bascom Hill it towers over the State Capitol as the building with the highest elevation in the city. Van Hise Hall was constructed in 1967 and its destruction is slated for sometime around 2025 as part of the university's campus master plan.\n[\n56\n]\nThe\nGeorge L. Mosse\nHumanities Building, located on Library Mall, was built in the late 1960s in the\nBrutalist\nstyle. Although debunked, the campus myth is that the building (with its poor ventilation, narrow windows, inclined base, and cantilevered upper floors) was designed to be \"riot-proof\".\n[\n57\n]\n[\n58\n]\nIts seven floors house the history, art, and music departments.

The older,\nMemorial Union\n, was built in 1928 to honor American World War I\nveterans\n. Also known as the Union or the Terrace, it has gained a reputation as one of the most beautiful student centers on a university campus. Located on the shore of\nLake Mendota\n, it is a popular spot for socializing among both students and the public, who enjoy gazing at the lake and its sailboats. The union is known for\nthe Rathskeller\n, a\nRatskeller\nor German pub adjacent to the lake terrace. Political debates and\nbackgammon\nand\nsheepshead\ngames over a beer on the terrace are common among students. The Rathskeller serves \"Rathskeller Ale\", a beer brewed expressly for the Terrace. Memorial Union was the first union at a public university to serve beer.\n[\n62\n]\nMemorial Union is home to many arts venues, including several art galleries, the Wisconsin Union Theater, and a craft shop that provides courses and facilities for arts and crafts activities. Students and Madison community members alike congregate at the Memorial Union for the films and concerts each week. An advisory referendum to renovate and expand Memorial Union was approved by the student body in 2006, and the university completed the renovation in 2017.\n[\n63\n]\nUnion South\nwas first built in 1971 to better accommodate a growing student enrollment. The original structure was demolished in 2008 and replaced with a\nLEED\n-certified building which opened in 2011.\n[\n64\n]\nThe building contains several dining options, an art gallery, a movie theater, a climbing wall, a bowling alley, event spaces, and a hotel.\n[\n65\n]\n[\n66\n]\nThe Wisconsin Union also provides a home for the Wisconsin Union Directorate Student Programming Board, which provides regular programs for both students and community members.

The departments around the Henry Mall area were conceived to be \"technical\" and geographically close to the science departments and the university farm.\n[\n68\n]\nThe Mall features several notable buildings, including\nAgriculture Hall\n, the Agronomy Building, the\nAgricultural Engineering Building\n, and the\nAgricultural Chemistry Building\n. The Mall is also home to several artworks, including the Hoard statue by\nGutzon Borglum\n, which honors\nWilliam Dempster Hoard\n, the publisher of Hoard's Dairyman magazine.\n[\n68\n]\n[\n69\n]\nThe Henry Boulder, a chunk of gneiss on the mall with a plaque, is dedicated to Dean\nWilliam Arnon Henry\n, the mall's namesake, who helped establish the College of Agriculture.\n[\n68\n]\nOther buildings in the area include the Stovall Lab of Hygiene and the Genetics Building.\n[\n70\n]\n[\n71\n]\nThe Henry Mall Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.\n[\n68\n]\nEffigy mounds\n[\nedit\n]\nUW–Madison claims more distinct archaeological sites than on any other university campus.\n[\n72\n]\nThe campus contains four clusters of\neffigy mounds\nlocated at Observatory Hill, Willow Drive, Picnic Point, and Eagle Heights. These sites, reflecting thousands of years of human habitation in the area, have survived to a greater or lesser degree on campus, depending on location and past building activities. Surviving sites are marked and fenced on the campus, ensuring that they are not disturbed. Wisconsin statutes protect effigy mounds by giving them a five-foot buffer zone.\n[\n73\n]\n[\n74\n]\nThe\nLakeshore Nature Preserve Committee\nis endeavoring to \"...safeguard beloved cultural landscapes,\" through aggressive enforcement of measures for the preservation of such zones and advocating for broader buffers where possible.\n[\n75\n]\nMuseums\n[\nedit\n]\nInterior of the\nChazen Museum of Art\nThe\nGeology Museum\nfeatures rocks, minerals, and fossils from around the world. Highlights include a blacklight room, a walk-through cave, and a fragment of the\nBarringer meteorite\n. Some noteworthy fossils include the first dinosaur skeleton assembled in Wisconsin (an\nEdmontosaurus\n), a shark (\nSqualicorax\n) and a floating colony of\nsea lilies\n(\nUintacrinus\n), both from the\nCretaceous\nchalk of\nKansas\n, and the Boaz\nMastodon\n, a found on a farm in southwestern Wisconsin in 1897.\n[\n76\n]\nThe\nChazen Museum of Art\n, formerly the Elvehjem Museum of Art, maintains a collection of paintings, drawings, sculpture, prints and photographs spanning over 700 years of art.\n[\n77\n]\nThe university's Zoological Museum maintains a collection of approximately 500,000 zoological specimens, which can be used for research and instruction. A special collection contains skeletons, artifacts, and research papers associated with the\nGalápagos Islands\n.

Beginning in 1890, the university's first Bucky Badger was a live, temperamental and unruly badger who was quickly retired. Although the nickname of the Wisconsin teams remained the \"Badgers\", it was not until Art Evans drew the early caricature version of Bucky in 1940 that today's recognizable image of Bucky was adopted. In 1949, a contest was held to name the mascot, but no consensus was reached after only a few entries were received. In reaction, the contest committee chose the name Buckingham U. Badger, or \"Bucky\", for short.\nAt Wisconsin football games in the 1920s live mascots were used to inspire fans. The animals used included a black bear, a bonnet monkey, and live badgers. 1949 was the first year a student sporting a papier-mâché badger head appeared; this subsequently replaced the use of live badgers.\n[\n201\n]\nThe team's nickname originates from the\nstate nickname\n. In the 1820s, many lead miners and their families lived in the mines in which they worked until adequate above-ground shelters were built, and thus were compared to badgers.\n[\n202\n]\n[\n203\n]\nIn 2009, Fulton Market Films produced the documentary\nBeing Bucky\nwhich followed the lives of seven Wisconsin students who take on the role of Bucky Badger.\n[\n204\n]\nBeing Bucky\nwon \"Best Documentary Film\" at the\nWisconsin Film Festival\nand went on to play in local Wisconsin movie theaters.\n[\n205\n]\nPeople\n[\nedit\n]\nFor a more comprehensive list, see\nList of University of Wisconsin–Madison people\n.\nAlumni\n[\nedit\n]\nOver its history, UW–Madison alumni, faculty, or former faculty have distinguished themselves in a wide variety of fields, and have been awarded 20 Nobel Prizes and 41 Pulitzer Prizes.\n[\n206\n]\nUW–Madison graduates have been recipients of 32\nRhodes Scholarships\n,\n[\n207\n]\n22\nMarshall Scholarships\n,\n[\n208\n]\n25\nTruman Scholarships\n,\n[\n209\n]\n6\nChurchill Scholarships\n,\n[\n210\n]\nand 1\nMitchell Scholarship\n.\n[\n211\n]\nThe university has produced 828\nFulbright Scholars\n[\n212\n]\nand 20\nMacArthur Fellows\n.\n[\n213\n]\nUW–Madison alumni have occupied several prominent offices in the\nUnited States government\n, including Vice President of the United States (\nDick Cheney\n);\nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States\n(\nWiley Rutledge\n, BA);\nUnited States Secretary of State\n(\nLawrence Eagleburger\n, BA, MA);\nUnited States Secretary of Health and Human Services\n(\nWilbur J.

It is located south of\nInterstate 80\n, and east of Watt Avenue. It is a part of the\nSan Juan Unified School District\nwith a student body of approximately 1700 students from northeast Arden-Arcade and western\nCarmichael\n.\nMira Loma High School has been an IB World School since 1989, and is the largest\nInternational Baccalaureate\nprogram in Northern California.\n[\n3\n]\nMira Loma also achieves consistently high pass rates for IB exams, taken as part of the May session.\nAccording to Mira Loma, in 1996–1997 the school had a pass rate of 93%, with a 100% diploma attainment rate for students.\n[\n4\n]\nIn 2007–2008 the pass rate was 93% with a 100% diploma attainment rate.\n[\n5\n]\nBoth statistics are well above both the North American average (78%) and the world average (81%) for diploma attainment. For the 2015–2016 school year, Mira Loma has the highest average\nSAT\nscore in the Sacramento area.\n[\n6\n]\nEducation\n[\nedit\n]\nMira Loma offers a large number of\nInternational Baccalaureate\ncourses that prepare students for IB examinations every spring. The IB tests are either Standard Level (SL) or Higher Level (HL) based on the amount of coursework prior to the examination. Mira Loma students tested in 18 different IB subjects in 2016.\n[\n7\n]\nIt is one of the few campuses in its district to offer\nMandarin Chinese\nas well as\nJapanese\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nIt also offers\nSpanish\nand\nFrench\nas other foreign languages.\nAdditionally, AP Calculus is offered to eligible students, as well as AP Computer Science Principles. Other\nAdvanced Placement\ncourses (AP US History, AP Physics, AP Biology, AP Chemistry, AP Chinese, and AP Japanese) were previously offered at Mira Loma, but have since been discontinued in favor of a total IB campus.\nStudents\n[\nedit\n]\nStudents are enrolled from throughout the\nCarmichael\narea, but many of the students participating in the International Baccalaureate program enroll from as far as\nEl Dorado Hills, California\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe school has a high rate of poverty, with 47% of the students being considered socioeconomically disadvantaged. As of 2023, Mira Loma is a\nTitle I school\n. The school has a graduation rate of 91%. 64% of 11th grade students met or exceeded the English language-arts standards as set by the\nCalifornia Standardized Testing and Reporting (STAR) Program\n, and 54% of 11th grade students met or exceeded the mathematics standards as set by the same organization.\n[\n8\n]\nDemographics\n[\nedit\n]\nRace/Ethnicity\nAmerican Indian\nAsian\nBlack\nHispanic\nWhite\nPacific Islander\nTwo or More Races\nPercentage\n[\n9\n]\n<0.5%\n26%\n6.9%\n22%\n34%\n<1.4%\n7.4%\nAs of the 2023-2024 school year, Mira Loma enrolled 1632 students and the total minority enrollment is 65%.\n[\n10\n]\nDue to the diverse racial and ethnic enrollment of its students, Mira Loma has consistently ranked as one the most diverse public high schools in California.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\nExtracurricular activities\n[\nedit\n]\nAcademic competition\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Mira Loma\nNational Science Bowl\nteam (consisting of a group of students that answer gameshow-style questions on science and mathematics) won the national championship in 2009, 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015. With five victories, the school has more than any other in the history of Science Bowl, and their 3-year win streak is the second-longest in the history of the competition.\n[\n13\n]\nThe Mira Loma\nScience Olympiad\nteam regularly competes in the regional, state, and national level in various competitions sponsored by the\nUnited States Department of Energy\n. In 2016, the team won the National Tournament, and has placed highly in national competitions in other years.\n[\n14\n]\nMira Loma High School hosts the Sacramento Regional Science Olympiad every year.\n[\n15\n]\nMira Loma's Speech and Debate team was re-founded in 2005 by a small group of students, after Andrew Barkett and Peter Lee briefly participated as the Mira Loma team for Oxford/Policy debate in the 1994-1995 and 1995-1996 school years, winning the Sacramento/San Joaquin regional qualifying tournament and going to the state tournament in 1995.  The official coach of the team during the 1994-1995 season was English teacher Guy Roberts, but Barkett and Lee practiced with the\nJ John F. Kennedy High School\nteam for much of the season.\nMira Loma participates in the\nInternational Science Olympiads\nincluding Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Biology, and Astronomy.\nAthletics\n[\nedit\n]\nMira Loma also offers a full range of athletic teams at\nvarsity\n, junior varsity (JV) and freshman levels.\n[\n16\n]\nFall\nCross Country (Boys/Girls)\nFlag Football (Girls)\nFootball\nGolf (Girls)\nTennis (Girls)\nVolleyball (Girls)\nWater Polo (Boys/Girls)\nWinter\nBasketball (Boys/Girls)\nSoccer (Boys/Girls)\nWrestling\nSpring\nBaseball\nGolf (Boys)\nSoftball\nSwim (Boys/Girls)\nTennis (Boys)\nTrack & Field (Boys/Girls)\nIn 2025, the football team defeated\nForesthill\n48-14 to win the\nCIF Sac-Joaquin Section\nDivision VIII championship, which is for\n8-man football\n. Mira Loma was in its first section final since its 1981 team lost to\nPlacer\nin Division II.\n[\n17\n]\n[\n18\n]\nClubs\n[\nedit\n]\nMira Loma also offers a variety of extracurricular clubs that meet at lunch and after school. Some of these clubs include Science Bowl, VEX Robotics Club, Astronomy Club, Bioengineering Club, Culinary Club, Speech and Debate, Forces of Nature, Poetry Club, Math Club, Ping Pong Club, Books For Youth, Moot Court, B Sharps, as well as ethnic organizations such as Latinos Unidos, Black Students Union, and Desi Student Association.

French, Japanese, and Chinese clubs are also active on campus.\nTraditions\n[\nedit\n]\nSports-A-Rama\n[\nedit\n]\nMira Loma's highest attended and most anticipated event of the school year is Sports-A-Rama (SAR). It is a multi-class competition where\nfreshman\n,\nsophomore\n,\njuniors\nand\nseniors\nparticipate in various game-like events and performances.\nIn order to foster\nschool spirit\nand class camaraderie, preliminary activities such as\npenny wars\n,\nbroomball\n, and decoration parties are scheduled leading up to SAR.\nHistory\nSports-A-Rama is the brainchild of Doug Woodard, the activities director at La Sierra High School (Carmichael, CA). Some of the activities that he saw working as a director inspired him to come up with a much bigger idea: to create an event that would increase school spirit by involving all 4 classes competing in a dozen or more activities. Then in 1983, La Sierra closed down. The La Sierra High School juniors, sophomores, and freshmen brought this low-key SAR idea with them when they transferred to Mira Loma.\n[\n19\n]\nEvents\nObstacle Course\nCrab Soccer\nTug of War\nLayup Relay\nWheelbarrow Race\nHungry Hippos\n[[Penalty kick (association football)|Dizzy Penalty\nArcade Creek Project\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Mira Loma\nArcade Creek Project\nwas a project studying the riparian corridor of an urban watershed in Sacramento, California.

The university was established as New York's land-grant institution following authorization by the New York State Legislature.\n[\n19\n]\nEzra Cornell provided his farm in Ithaca, New York, as the initial campus site and contributed $500,000 as an initial endowment (equivalent to $13,074,000 in 2025). White agreed to serve as the university's first president.\nWhite oversaw the university's early development, including construction of its first two buildings, and traveled to recruit students and faculty.\n[\n20\n]\nThe university was formally inaugurated on October 7, 1868, with 412 male students enrolling the following day.\n[\n21\n]\nCornell developed as a technologically innovative institution, incorporating academic research into campus infrastructure and outreach. In 1883, it became one of the first electrified universities, employing a water-powered\ndynamo\nto light parts of the campus.\n[\n22\n]\nSince 1894, the university has incorporated state-funded colleges that fulfill statutory requirements, and it administers research and extension programs jointly funded by New York State and the U.S. federal government.\n[\n23\n]\n[\n24\n]\nIn 1872, Cornell became one of the first U.S. universities to allow alumni-elected trustees on its board.\n[\n25\n]\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Cornell was home to literary societies that promoted writing, reading, and oratory. The U.S. Bureau of Education classified several of these societies as following the traditions of literary organizations at Eastern universities.\n[\n26\n]\n20th century\n[\nedit\n]\nWillard Straight Hall\non the Cornell campus, which was occupied by armed anti-\nVietnam War\nprotesters in 1969, leading to the resignation of\nJames Alfred Perkins\n, Cornell's\nseventh president\nIn 1967, Cornell experienced a fire in the Residential Club dormitory that killed eight students and one professor. In the late 1960s, Cornell was among the\nIvy League\nuniversities that experienced heightened student activism related to cultural issues, civil rights, and opposition to U.S. involvement in the\nVietnam War\n. In 1969, armed anti–Vietnam War protesters occupied\nWillard Straight Hall\n, an incident that led to a restructuring of university governance and forced the resignation of then-president\nJames Alfred Perkins\n.\n[\n27\n]\nCornell University and its academic programs have routinely ranked among the best in the world. In 1995, the\nNational Research Council\nranked Cornell's Ph.D. programs sixth in the nation. It also ranked the academic quality of 18 individual Cornell Ph.D. programs among the top ten nationwide, including\nastrophysics\n(ninth),\nchemistry\n(sixth),\ncivil engineering\n(sixth),\ncomparative literature\n(sixth),\ncomputer science\n(fifth), ecology (fourth),\nelectrical engineering\n(seventh),\nEnglish\n(seventh),\nFrench\n(eighth),\ngeosciences\n(tenth),\nGerman\n(third),\nlinguistics\n(ninth),\nmaterials science\n(third),\nmechanical engineering\n(seventh),\nphilosophy\n(ninth),\nphysics\n(sixth),\nSpanish\n(eighth), and\nstatistics\n/\nbiostatistics\n(fourth).

The Governor,\nTemporary President of the Senate\n,\nSpeaker of the Assembly\n, and president of the university serve in\nex officio\nvoting capacities. The board is responsible for electing a President to serve as the university's chief executive and educational officer.\n[\n106\n]\n[\n107\n]\nFrom 2014 to 2022,\nRobert Harrison\nserved as chairman of the board. He was succeeded by Kraig Kayser.\n[\n108\n]\nThe Board of Trustees holds four regular meetings annually, which are subject to the New York State Open Meetings Law.\n[\n109\n]\nThe university charter (specifically, paragraph 1.b of section 5703 of the Education Law) provides that one member of the board, the life trustee, is the eldest living lineal descendant of Ezra Cornell.\n[\n104\n]\nAs of 2024, the current and longest-serving life trustee is Ezra Cornell, class of 1971, the great-great-great-grandson of the original Ezra Cornell.\n[\n110\n]\nHe celebrated 50 years of service as a board member in 2019.\n[\n110\n]\nHis eldest daughter Katy Cornell, class of 2001, is expected to become the next life trustee.\n[\n110\n]\nOn July 1, 2024,\nMichael Kotlikoff\n, who served as Cornell's 16th provost, began a two-year term as interim president,\n[\n111\n]\nsucceeding\nMartha E.

All academic departments at Cornell are affiliated with at least one college. Several inter-school academic departments offer courses in more than one college. Students pursuing graduate degrees in these schools are enrolled in\nCornell University Graduate School\n. The\nSchool of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions\nprovides additional programs for college and high school students, professionals, and other adults.\n[\n113\n]\nCornell's four\nstatutory colleges\ninclude the\nCollege of Agriculture and Life Sciences\n,\nCollege of Human Ecology\n,\nSchool of Industrial and Labor Relations\n, and\nCollege of Veterinary Medicine\n. In the 2010–2011 fiscal year, these four colleges received $131.9 million in\nState University of New York\n(SUNY) appropriations to support teaching, research, and service missions, making them accountable to SUNY trustees and state agencies.\n[\n114\n]\n[\n115\n]\n[\n116\n]\nNew York residents enrolled in these colleges qualify for discounted tuition; however, their academic activities are considered by New York state to be private and non-state entities.\n[\n117\n]\nCornell's nine privately endowed, non-statutory colleges include the\nCollege of Arts and Sciences\n,\nCollege of Architecture, Art, and Planning\n,\nCollege of Engineering\n, and\nNolan School of Hotel Administration\n, each of which operate independently of state funding and oversight, which grants them greater autonomy in determining their academic programs, admissions, and advising. They also do not offer discounted tuition for New York residents.\nAs of 2023, among Cornell's 15,182 undergraduate students, 4,602 (30.3%) are affiliated with the College of Arts and Sciences, which is the largest college by enrollment, followed by 3,203 (21.1%) in Engineering, and 3,101 (20.4%) in Agriculture and Life Sciences. The smallest of the seven undergraduate colleges is Architecture, Art, and Planning, with 503 (3.3%) students.\n[\n7\n]\nFundraising and financial support\n[\nedit\n]\nPhilanthropy has played a central role in Cornell University's growth, funding major academic programs, research initiatives, and campus development. As of 2024, the university's endowment stands at $10.7 billion,\n[\n5\n]\nmaking it the\n14th-largest\namong U.S. universities. In 2018, Cornell raised $743 million in private donations, ranking third behind\nHarvard University\nand\nStanford University\n.\n[\n118\n]\nMajor single-donor contributions in recent decades have significantly shaped Cornell's professional schools. In 1998,\nWeill Cornell Medicine\nwas renamed after a $100 million gift from\nSanford I. Weill\n, a 1955 alumnus and former\nCitibank\nCEO. By 2013, the Weills' total donations exceeded $600 million.\n[\n119\n]\nIn 2017,\nHerbert Fisk Johnson III\n, an alumnus and chairman of\nS. C. Johnson & Son\n, donated $150 million to support the\nCornell Johnson Graduate School of Management\n, one of the largest gifts to a business school.\n[\n120\n]\nCornell Tech\n, the university's technology-focused graduate campus on\nRoosevelt Island\n, has received major philanthropic support. In 2011,\nChuck Feeney\n, a 1956 alumnus and founder of\nDFS Group\n, became Cornell's largest private donor, contributing $1 billion to fund the campus and other initiatives.\n[\n121\n]\nIn 2015,\nIrwin M. Jacobs\n, a 1956 alumnus and\nQualcomm\nfounder, and his wife, Joan, donated $133 million to establish the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech.\n[\n122\n]\nOther major gifts have supported research and sustainability efforts. In 2010, David and Patricia Atkinson donated $80 million to establish the\nAtkinson Center for a Sustainable Future\n, funding research on environmental and sustainability challenges.\n[\n123\n]\nAcademics\n[\nedit\n]\nCornell is a large and primarily residential research university, and a majority of its students are enrolled in undergraduate programs.\n[\n124\n]\nSince 1921, the university has been\naccredited\nby the\nMiddle States Commission on Higher Education\nand its predecessor.\n[\n125\n]\nCornell operates on a 4–1–4 academic calendar, with the fall term beginning in late August and ending in early December, a three-week winter session in January, and the spring term beginning in late January and ending in early May.\n[\n126\n]\nCornell is a\nland-\n,\nspace-\n, and\nsea-grant\nuniversity, and until 2014 was a\nsun-grant\nuniversity as well.\n[\n127\n]\nUndergraduate admissions\n[\nedit\n]\nUndergraduate admissions statistics\n2022 entering\nclass\n[\n128\n]\nAdmit rate\n6.9%\nYield rate\n69%\nTest scores\nmiddle 50%\nSAT\nEBRW\n700–760\nSAT\nMath\n750–800\nACT\nComposite\n33–35\nHigh school\nGPA\n[ii]\nTop 10%\n83.7%\nTop 25%\n97.7%\nTop 50%\n99.9%\nAmong students who chose to submit\nAmong students whose school ranked\nAdmission to Cornell University is highly competitive.

The university is responsible for many modern scientific advancements and is among a small group of\ninstitutes of technology in the United States\nthat are devoted to the instruction of pure and applied sciences.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\nThe institution was founded as a preparatory and vocational school by\nAmos G. Throop\nin 1891 and began attracting influential scientists such as\nGeorge Ellery Hale\n,\nArthur Amos Noyes\n, and\nRobert Andrews Millikan\nin the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910, and the college assumed its present name in 1920. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the\nAssociation of American Universities\n, and the antecedents of\nNASA\n's\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under\nTheodore von Kármán\n.\n[\n12\n]\n[\n13\n]\nCaltech has six academic divisions with strong emphasis on science and engineering, managing $332 million in research grants as of 2010.\n[\n14\n]\nIts 124-acre (50 ha) primary campus is located approximately 11 mi (18 km) northeast of\ndowntown Los Angeles\n, in Pasadena. First-year students are required to live on campus, and 95% of undergraduates remain in the on-campus\nhousing system at Caltech\n. Students agree to abide by an honor code which allows faculty to assign\ntake-home examinations\n.\n[\n15\n]\nThe\nCaltech Beavers\ncompete in 13 intercollegiate sports in the\nNCAA\nDivision III\n's\nSouthern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference\n(SCIAC).\nScientists and engineers at or from the university have played an essential role in many modern scientific breakthroughs and innovations, including advances in\nspace research\n,\nsustainability science\n,\nquantum physics\n, and\nseismology\n.\n[\n16\n]\n[\n11\n]\n[\n17\n]\nAs of October 2024\n[update]\n, there are\n80 Nobel laureates who have been affiliated with Caltech\n, making it the institution with the highest number of Nobelists per capita in America.\n[\n18\n]\n[\n19\n]\nThis includes 48 alumni and faculty members (49 prizes, with chemist\nLinus Pauling\nbeing the only individual in history to win two unshared prizes). In addition, 68\nNational Medal of Science\nRecipients, 43\nMacArthur Fellows\n, 15\nNational Medal of Technology and Innovation\nrecipients, 11\nastronauts\n, 5\nScience Advisors to the President\n, 4\nFields Medalists\n, and 6\nTuring Award\nwinners have been affiliated with Caltech.\n[\n20\n]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThroop College\n[\nedit\n]\nThroop Polytechnic Institute on its original campus at downtown Pasadena, c. 1897–1900s\nCaltech started as a vocational school founded in present-day\nOld Pasadena\non\nFair Oaks Avenue\nand Chestnut Street on September 23, 1891, by local businessman and politician\nAmos G. Throop\n.\n[\n21\n]\nThe school was known successively as\nThroop University\n,\nThroop Polytechnic Institute\n(and Manual Training School)\n[\n22\n]\nand\nThroop College of Technology\nbefore acquiring its current name in 1920.\n[\n14\n]\n[\n23\n]\nThe vocational school was disbanded and the preparatory program was split off to form the independent\nPolytechnic School\nin 1907.\nAt a time when scientific research in the United States was still in its infancy,\nGeorge Ellery Hale\n, a solar\nastronomer\nfrom the\nUniversity of Chicago\n, founded the\nMount Wilson Observatory\nin 1904. He joined Throop's board of trustees in 1907, and soon began developing the university, and the whole of Pasadena, into a major scientific and cultural destination. He engineered the appointment of\nJames A. B. Scherer\n, a literary scholar untutored in science but very capable in administration and fund-raising, to Throop's presidency in 1908. Scherer persuaded retired businessman and trustee Charles W. Gates to donate $25,000 in seed money (equivalent to $900,000 in 2025) to build Gates Laboratory, the first science building on campus.\n[\n24\n]\nWorld Wars\n[\nedit\n]\nThroop Hall, 1912\nConstruction of Norman Bridge Laboratory of Physics in 1921\nAerial view of Caltech in 1922\nIn 1910, Throop moved to its current site. Arthur Fleming donated the land for the permanent campus site.\nTheodore Roosevelt\ndelivered an address at Throop Institute on March 21, 1911, and he declared:\nI want to see institutions like Throop turn out perhaps ninety-nine of every hundred students as men who are to do given pieces of industrial work better than any one else can do them; I want to see those men do the kind of work that is now being done on the\nPanama Canal\nand on the great irrigation projects in the interior of this country—and the one-hundredth man I want to see with the kind of cultural scientific training that will make him and his fellows the matrix out of which you can occasionally develop a man like your great astronomer, George Ellery Hale.\n[\n25\n]\n[\n26\n]\nAlso in 1911, a bill was introduced in the\nCalifornia Legislature\ncalling for the establishment of a publicly funded \"California Institute of Technology,\" with an initial budget of a million dollars, ten times the budget of Throop at the time. The board of trustees offered to turn Throop over to the state, but the presidents of\nStanford University\nand the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\nsuccessfully lobbied to defeat the bill, which allowed Throop to develop as the only scientific research-oriented educational institute in southern California, public or private, until the onset of World War II necessitated the broader development of research-based science education.\n[\n27\n]\nThe promise of Throop attracted\nphysical chemist\nArthur Amos Noyes\nfrom\nMIT\nto develop the institution and assist in establishing it as a center for science and technology.\nWith the onset of\nWorld War I\n, Hale organized the\nNational Research Council\nto coordinate and support scientific work on military problems. While he supported the idea of federal appropriations for science, he took exception to a federal bill that would have funded engineering research at land-grant colleges, and instead sought to raise a $1 million national research fund entirely from private sources. To that end, as Hale wrote in\nThe New York Times\n:\nThroop College of Technology, in Pasadena California has recently afforded a striking illustration of one way in which the Research Council can secure co-operation and advance scientific investigation. This institution, with its able investigators and excellent research laboratories, could be of great service in any broad scheme of cooperation. President Scherer, hearing of the formation of the council, immediately offered to take part in its work, and with this object, he secured within three days an additional research endowment of one hundred thousand dollars.\n[\n28\n]\nThrough the National Research Council, Hale simultaneously lobbied for science to play a larger role in national affairs, and for Throop to play a national role in science. The new funds were designated for physics research, and ultimately led to the establishment of the Norman Bridge Laboratory, which attracted experimental\nphysicist\nRobert Andrews Millikan\nfrom the\nUniversity of Chicago\nin 1917.\n[\n29\n]\nDuring the course of the war, Hale, Noyes and Millikan worked together in Washington on the NRC. Subsequently, they continued their partnership in developing Caltech.\n[\n28\n]\nCaltech entrance at 1200 E California Blvd.  On the left is East Norman Bridge Laboratory of Physics and on the right is the Linde Hall of Mathematics and Physics.\nUnder the leadership of\nHale\n,\nNoyes\n, and\nMillikan\n(aided by the booming economy of\nSouthern California\n), Caltech grew to national prominence in the 1920s and concentrated on the development of Roosevelt's \"Hundredth Man\". On November 29, 1921, the trustees declared it to be the express policy of the institute to pursue scientific research of the greatest importance and at the same time \"to continue to conduct thorough courses in engineering and pure science, basing the work of these courses on exceptionally strong instruction in the fundamental sciences of mathematics, physics, and chemistry; broadening and enriching the curriculum by a liberal amount of instruction in such subjects as English, history, and economics; and vitalizing all the work of the Institute by the infusion in generous measure of the spirit of research\".\n[\n25\n]\n[\n26\n]\nIn 1923, Millikan was awarded the\nNobel Prize in Physics\n. In 1925, the school established a department of geology and hired\nWilliam Bennett Munro\n, then chairman of the division of History, Government, and Economics at\nHarvard University\n, to create a division of\nhumanities\nand\nsocial sciences\nat Caltech. In 1928, a division of\nbiology\nwas established under the leadership of\nThomas Hunt Morgan\n, the most distinguished biologist in the United States at the time, and discoverer of the role of genes and the\nchromosome\nin heredity. In 1930,\nKerckhoff Marine Laboratory\nwas established in Corona del Mar under the care of Professor\nGeorge MacGinitie\n. In 1926, a graduate school of\naeronautics\nwas created, which eventually attracted\nTheodore von Kármán\n. Kármán later helped create the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and played an integral part in establishing Caltech as one of the world's centers for\nrocket science\n. In 1928, construction of the\nPalomar Observatory\nbegan.\nRichard C. Tolman\nand\nAlbert Einstein\nat Caltech, 1932\nMillikan served as \"Chairman of the Executive Council\" (effectively Caltech's president) from 1921 to 1945, and his influence was such that the institute was occasionally referred to as \"Millikan's School\". Millikan initiated a visiting-scholars program soon after joining Caltech. Notable scientists who accepted his invitation include\nPaul Dirac\n,\nErwin Schrödinger\n,\nWerner Heisenberg\n,\nHendrik Lorentz\nand\nNiels Bohr\n.\n[\n30\n]\nAlbert Einstein\narrived on the Caltech campus for the first time in 1931 to polish up his\nTheory of General Relativity\n, and he returned to Caltech subsequently as a visiting professor in 1932 and 1933.\n[\n31\n]\nDuring World War II, Caltech was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the\nV-12 Navy College Training Program\nwhich offered students a path to a Navy commission.\n[\n32\n]\nThe\nUnited States Navy\nalso maintained a naval training school for\naeronautical engineering\n, resident inspectors of ordinance and naval material, and a liaison officer to the\nNational Defense Research Committee\non campus.\n[\n33\n]\nDuring the war,  some scientists from Caltech, including\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer\n,\nRichard Tolman\n, and\nRobert Bacher\n, were instrumental in the\nManhattan Project\nand contributed to critical aspects of the atomic bomb's development.\n[\n34\n]\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer\nat Caltech in 1930\nCaltech was also directly involved in other bomb-related research with a group led by\nCharles Lauritsen\nwhich assisted in the development of the high-explosive lenses used in the\nFat Man\nimplosion bomb, crucial to the\nTrinity Test\nand the subsequent\nbombing of Nagasaki\n.\n[\n35\n]\nLauritsen's team at Caltech developed detonators that would later be used in atomic bombs. In November 1943, Caltech and the U.S. Navy established the\nNaval Ordnance Test Station\n(NOTS) in\nInyokern, California\n, near the\nMojave Desert\nto work on aircraft ordnance and rocket development.\n[\n36\n]\nOne of the most successful innovations was the development of the 5-inch\nHigh-Velocity Aircraft Rocket\n, commonly known as the \"\nHoly Moses\n,\" which was used in combat against enemy fortifications and ships.\n[\n37\n]\nThe partnership between the Navy and Caltech continued to deepen throughout the war, leading to the creation of several military technologies, and by 1945, the focus of Caltech's war contributions expanded further with\nProject Camel\n, a collaboration between the Naval Ordnance Test Station and the Manhattan Project.\n[\n38\n]\nCaltech scientists worked on a variety of assignments, including\nB-29\nairdrop tests of model atomic bombs and the manufacturing of explosives for use in the atomic bomb's implosion mechanism.\n[\n38\n]\nAdditionally, the\nSalt Wells Pilot Plant\nat Inyokern was developed with Caltech scientists in response to concerns about the safety of explosive production at\nLos Alamos\nand began producing high explosives just days before the Trinity Test in July 1945.\n[\n39\n]\nEarly in the war, Caltech scientists, including Lauritsen's son,\nThomas Lauritsen\n, worked on various rocket designs at the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory.\n[\n38\n]\nThese rockets, including the \"\nTiny Tim\n\" and the \"\nMighty Mouse\n,\" were used in critical military operations, from naval engagements to land assaults. By the end of the war, Caltech had essentially become an extension of the U.S. Navy's\nBureau of Ordnance\n, with its rocket research providing important technology to U.S. combat capabilities.\n[\n40\n]\nProject Vista\n[\nedit\n]\nThe campus in 1944\nFrom April to December 1951, Caltech was the host of a federal classified study,\nProject Vista\n. The selection of Caltech as host for the project was based on the university's expertise in rocketry and nuclear physics. In response to the war in Korea and the pressure from the Soviet Union, the project was Caltech's way of assisting the federal government in its effort to increase national security.\n[\n41\n]\nThe project was created to study new ways of improving the relationship between tactical air support and ground troops. The Army, Air Force, and Navy sponsored the project; however, it was under contract with the Army. The study was named after the hotel, Vista del Arroyo Hotel, which housed the study. The study operated under a committee with the supervision of President\nLee A. DuBridge\n.\nWilliam A. Fowler\n, a professor at Caltech, was selected as research director. More than a fourth of Caltech's faculty and a group of outside scientists staffed the project.\n[\n42\n]\nMoreover, the number increases if one takes into account visiting scientists, military liaisons, secretarial, and security staff. In compensation for its participation, the university received about $750,000.\n[\n43\n]\nPost-war growth\n[\nedit\n]\nFrom the 1950s to 1980s, Caltech was the home of\nMurray Gell-Mann\nand\nRichard Feynman\n, whose work was central to the establishment of the\nStandard Model\nof particle physics. Feynman was also widely known outside the physics community as an exceptional teacher and a colorful, unconventional character.\nDuring\nLee A. DuBridge\n's tenure as Caltech's president (1946–1969), Caltech's faculty doubled and the campus tripled in size. DuBridge, unlike his predecessors, welcomed\nfederal funding\nof science. New research fields flourished, including\nchemical biology\n,\nplanetary science\n,\nnuclear astrophysics\n, and\ngeochemistry\n. A\n200-inch telescope\nwas dedicated on nearby Palomar Mountain in 1948 and remained the world's most powerful optical telescope for over forty years.\n[\n44\n]\nCaltech opened its doors to female undergraduates during the presidency of\nHarold Brown\nin 1970, and they made up 14% of the entering class.\n[\n45\n]\nThe portion of female undergraduates has been increasing since then.\n[\n4\n]\nProtests by Caltech students are rare.\n[\n46\n]\nThe earliest was a 1968 protest outside the\nNBC\nBurbank studios, in response to rumors that NBC was to cancel\nStar Trek\n. In 1973, the students from\nDabney House\nprotested a presidential visit with a sign on the library bearing the simple phrase \"\nImpeach Nixon\n\". The following week, Ross McCollum, president of the National Oil Company, wrote an open letter to Dabney House stating that in light of their actions he had decided not to donate one million dollars to Caltech. The Dabney family, being Republicans, disowned Dabney House after hearing of the protest.\n[\n47\n]\n21st century\n[\nedit\n]\nSince 2000, the\nEinstein Papers Project\nhas been located at Caltech.\n[\n48\n]\nThe project was established in 1986 to assemble, preserve, translate, and publish papers selected from the literary estate of Albert Einstein and from other collections.\nIn fall 2008, the freshman class was 42% female, a record for Caltech's undergraduate enrollment.\n[\n4\n]\nIn the same year, the Institute concluded a six-year-long fund-raising campaign. The campaign raised more than $1.4 billion from about 16,000 donors. Nearly half of the funds went into the support of Caltech programs and projects.\n[\n49\n]\nIn 2010, Caltech, in partnership with\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\nand headed by Professor\nNathan Lewis\n, established a\nDOE\nEnergy Innovation Hub\naimed at developing revolutionary methods to generate fuels directly from sunlight. This hub, the\nJoint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis\n, will receive up to $122 million in federal funding over five years.\n[\n50\n]\nSince 2012, Caltech began to offer classes through\nmassive open online courses\n(MOOCs) under\nCoursera\n, from 2013,\nedX\n.\n[\n51\n]\nSince 2020, Caltech’s Center for Technology and Management Education (CTME) has provided professional certificate programs and bootcamps targeted at working professionals. Beginning in 2022, CTME faced a class-action lawsuit alleging that its cybersecurity bootcamp was misleadingly marketed as a Caltech program, despite being fully designed and taught by the third-party company Simplilearn without Caltech faculty involvement.  The lawsuit asserted that students were misled by the use of Caltech branding. In response, Caltech announced it would end its partnership with Simplilearn and restructure CTME programs under internal oversight.\n[\n52\n]\nJean-Lou Chameau, the eighth president, announced on February 19, 2013, that he would be stepping down to accept the presidency at\nKing Abdullah University of Science and Technology\n.\n[\n53\n]\nThomas F. Rosenbaum\nwas announced to be the ninth president of Caltech on October 24, 2013, and his term began on July 1, 2014.\nThe\nLaser Interferometer Gravitational‑Wave Observatory\n(LIGO) was designed and constructed by a team of scientists from the California Institute of Technology,\nMIT\n, and industrial partners, funded by the\nNational Science Foundation\n. It was intended to launch\ngravitational‑wave astronomy\nby detecting the ripples in spacetime predicted by\nEinstein’s general relativity\n.\n[\n54\n]\nGravitational waves were directly\ndetected for the first time\non September 14, 2015, by the LIGO detectors. For their pivotal roles in building the LIGO observatory and making the discovery, Caltech physicists\nKip Thorne\nand\nBarry Barish\n, together with MIT physicist\nRainer Weiss\n, were awarded the 2017\nNobel Prize in Physics\n.\n[\n55\n]\nThorne, who is a Caltech graduate, provided the theoretical foundation that guided LIGO's design.\n[\n55\n]\nIn 2019, Caltech received a gift of $750 million for sustainability research from the Resnick family of\nThe Wonderful Company\n.\n[\n56\n]\nThe gift is the largest ever for environmental sustainability research and the second-largest private donation to a US academic institution (after Bloomberg's gift of $1.8 billion to Johns Hopkins University in 2018).\n[\n57\n]\nIn January 2021, the Caltech Board of Trustees authorized the removal the names of six historical figures—including inaugural president\nRobert Millikan\n,\nHarry Chandler\n, Albert Ruddock—from campus buildings due to their affiliations with the\nHuman Betterment Foundation\n, an American eugenics organization.\n[\n58\n]\nAs a result, Millikan Library was renamed Caltech Hall, Chandler Dining Hall became Lee F. Browne Dining Hall, Ruddock House was renamed Grant D. Venerable House (after Caltech’s first Black graduate).\nCampus\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nCampus of the California Institute of Technology\nCaltech's 124-acre (50 ha) primary campus is located in\nPasadena, California\n, approximately 11 miles (18 km) northeast of\ndowntown Los Angeles\n. It is within walking distance of\nOld Town Pasadena\nand the\nPasadena Playhouse District\nand therefore the two locations are frequent getaways for Caltech students.\nIn 1917 Hale hired architect\nBertram Goodhue\nto produce a master plan for the 22 acres (8.9 ha) campus. Goodhue conceived the overall layout of the campus and designed the physics building, Dabney Hall, and several other structures, in which he sought to be consistent with the local climate, the character of the school, and Hale's educational philosophy. Goodhue's designs for Caltech were also influenced by the traditional\nSpanish mission architecture\nof Southern California.\nDuring the 1960s, Caltech underwent considerable expansion, in part due to the philanthropy of alumnus and professor\nArnold O. Beckman\n. In 1953, Beckman was asked to join the Caltech Board of Trustees.\n[\n59\n]\n: 282\nIn 1964, he became its chairman.\n[\n59\n]\n: 275\nOver the next few years, as Caltech's president emeritus\nDavid Baltimore\ndescribed it, Arnold Beckman and his wife Mabel \"shaped the destiny of Caltech.\"\n[\n59\n]\n: 288\nIn 1971 a\nmagnitude-6.6 earthquake\nin\nSan Fernando\ncaused some damage to the Caltech campus. Engineers who evaluated the damage found that two historic buildings dating from the early days of the Institute—Throop Hall and the Goodhue-designed Culbertson Auditorium—had cracked.\nNew additions to the campus include the Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics and the\nWalter\nand\nLeonore Annenberg\nCenter for Information Science and Technology, which opened in 2009,\n[\n60\n]\n[\n61\n]\nand the Warren and Katherine Schlinger Laboratory for Chemistry and Chemical Engineering followed in March 2010.\n[\n62\n]\nThe institute also concluded an upgrading of the\nSouth Houses\nin 2006. In late 2010, Caltech completed a 1.3 MW\nsolar array\nprojected to produce approximately 1.6 GWh in 2011.\n[\n63\n]\nAerial view of Caltech in\nPasadena, California\nMillikan Library, the tallest building on campus.\nThe Beckman Auditorium\nBeckman Institute at Caltech\nThe Bridge Laboratory of Physics\nBroad Center for Biological Sciences\nAnnenberg Center for Information Science and Technology\nBreezeway of Arms Laboratory\nKerckhoff Laboratory of the Biological Sciences\nSchlinger Laboratory for Chemistry and Chemical Engineering\nCahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics\nFleming cannon\nOrganization and administration\n[\nedit\n]\nCaltech is incorporated as a non-profit corporation and is governed by a privately appointed 46-member\nboard of trustees\nwho serve five-year terms of office and retire at the age of 72.\n[\n23\n]\n[\n64\n]\nThe trustees elect a president to serve as the chief executive officer of the institute and administer the affairs on the institute on behalf of the board, a provost who serves as the chief academic officer of the institute below the president, and ten other vice presidential and other senior positions.\n[\n64\n]\nThomas F. Rosenbaum\nbecame the ninth president of Caltech in 2014. Caltech's endowment is governed by a permanent trustee committee and administered by an investment office.\nThe institute is organized into six primary academic divisions: Biology and Biological Engineering (founded 1927), Chemistry and Chemical Engineering (founded 1926), Engineering and Applied Science (founded 1926), Geological and Planetary Sciences (founded 1927), Humanities and Social Sciences (founded 1926), Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy (founded 1926). Given Caltech's historical prestige and the small size of its faculty in many major fields, the institution is exceptionally careful in selecting candidates. This rigorous process can result in some positions remaining unfilled for several years until the right candidate is found.\n[\n65\n]\nCaltech dedicates significant resources to attract top-tier faculty and provides them with substantial financial support to foster their research and academic endeavors.\n[\n66\n]\nThe voting faculty of Caltech include all professors, instructors, research associates and fellows, and the University Librarian. Faculty are responsible for establishing admission requirements, academic standards, and curricula. The Faculty Board is the faculty's representative body and consists of 18 elected faculty representatives as well as other senior administration officials. Full-time professors are expected to teach classes, conduct research, advise students, and perform administrative work such as serving on committees.\n[\n67\n]\nFounded in 1930s, the\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n(JPL) is a\nfederally funded research and development center\n(FFRDC) owned by\nNASA\nand operated as a division of Caltech through a contract between NASA and Caltech. In 2008, JPL spent over $1.6 billion on research and development and employed over 5,000 project-related and support employees.\n[\n68\n]\nThe JPL Director also serves as a Caltech Vice President and is responsible to the President of the Institute for the management of the laboratory.\n[\n69\n]\nIn December 2023, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers filed to be recognized for collective bargaining as\nCaltech Grad researchers and Postdocs United\n, in affiliation with the\nUnited Auto Workers\n(C/GPU-UAW). On January 31 and February 1, 2024, a vote was held by the\nNational Labor Relations Board\n(NLRB). In February 2024, the NLRB certified that 1335 of 1997 eligible workers voted, with 78% voting in favor of unionization. In May 2024, contract negotiations began.\n[\n70\n]\nIn December 2024, C/GPU-UAW members held a strike authorization vote,\n[\n71\n]\n1441 participating in the vote, and 86% voting in favor of authorizing the C/GPU bargaining team to call a strike, if necessary.\n[\n72\n]\nAcademics\n[\nedit\n]\nCaltech is a small four-year, highly residential research university with slightly more students in graduate programs than undergraduate.\n[\n73\n]\nThe institute has been accredited by the\nWestern Association of Schools and Colleges\nsince 1949.\n[\n74\n]\n[\n75\n]\nCaltech is on the\nquarter system\n:\n[\n76\n]\nthe fall term starts in late September and ends before Christmas, the second term starts after New Year's Day and ends in mid-March, and the third term starts in late March or early April and ends in early June.\n[\n77\n]\nUndergraduate admissions\n[\nedit\n]\nUndergraduate admissions statistics\n2028 entering\nclass\n[\n78\n]\nChange vs.\n2023\n[\n79\n]\nAdmit rate\n2.6%\n(\n−3.8)\nYield rate\n61.2%\n(\n+17.3)\nTest scores\nmiddle 50%\nSAT\nTotal\n1530⁠–1570\nACT\nComposite\n35–36\nCaltech Undergraduate Admissions Statistics\n[\n80\n]\n[\n81\n]\n[\n82\n]\n[\n83\n]\n[\n84\n]\nYear\nAdmit Rate\nYield Rate\n2024\n2.6%\n61.2%\n2023\n3.1%\n60.2%\n2022\n2.7%\n50.0%\n2021\n3.9%\n52.9%\n2020\n6.7%\n42.0%\n2019\n6.4%\n43.9%\nAdmission to Caltech is extremely rigorous. Prior to going test blind, Caltech students had the highest test scores in the nation.\n[\n85\n]\n[\n86\n]\nIn admissions for the Class of 2028 (entering 2024), Caltech was ranked the hardest college in America to gain acceptance to by admit rate, at an all-time low of 2.7%.\n[\n87\n]\nFor the freshmen who enrolled in 2019 (Class of 2023) the middle 50% range of\nSAT\nwere 740–780 for evidence-based reading and writing and 790–800 for math, and 1530–1570 total. The middle 50% range\nACT\nComposite score was 35–36. The SAT Math Level 2 middle 50% range was 800–800. The middle 50% range for the SAT Physics Subject Test was 760–800; SAT Chemistry Subject Test was 760–800; \nSAT Biology Subject Tests was 760–800.\n[\n88\n]\nIn June 2020, Caltech announced a test-blind policy where they would not require nor consider test scores for the next two years. The moratorium was extended twice, starting July 2021, but was subsequently cancelled starting with the Class of 2029.\n[\n89\n]\n[\n90\n]\nThe institute is\nneed-blind\nfor domestic applicants.\n[\n91\n]\nFor the Class of 2027 (enrolled Fall 2023), Caltech received 13,136 applications and accepted 412 applicants for a 3.14% admit rate; 270 enrolled.\n[\n92\n]\n[\n93\n]\nThe subsequent year, for the Class of 2028, Caltech reduced the number of seats by almost one hundred, accepting 315 applicants out of approximately 13,000 total applications.\n[\n93\n]\n[\n94\n]\nFor the Class of 2025, 32% were of underrepresented ancestry (which includes students who self-identify as American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic/Latino, Black/African American, and/or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander), and 6% were foreign students.\n[\n88\n]\nTuition and financial aid\n[\nedit\n]\nUndergraduate tuition for the 2021–2022 school year was $56,394 and total annual costs were estimated to be $79,947 excluding the Caltech Student Health Insurance Plan.\n[\n95\n]\nIn 2012–2013, Caltech awarded $17.1 million in need-based aid, $438k in non-need-based aid, and $2.51 million in self-help support to enrolled undergraduate students. The average financial aid package of all students eligible for aid was $38,756 and students graduated with an average debt of $15,090.\n[\n76\n]\nUndergraduate program\n[\nedit\n]\nThe full-time, four-year undergraduate program emphasizes instruction in the arts and sciences and has high graduate coexistence.\n[\n73\n]\nCaltech offers 28 majors (called \"options\") and 17 minors across all six academic divisions.\n[\n96\n]\n[\n97\n]\nCaltech also offers interdisciplinary programs in Applied Physics, Biochemistry, Bioengineering, Computation and Neural Systems, Control and Dynamical Systems, Environmental Science and Engineering, Geobiology and Astrobiology, Geochemistry, and Planetary Astronomy. The most popular options are Chemical Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Physics.\n[\n98\n]\nThe most popular majors of the class of 2023 were Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Physics, and Electrical Engineering.\nAll undergraduates are required to complete the core curriculum, which consists of 108 units typically completed in the first two years, providing a rigorous foundation in science, mathematics, humanities, and physical education to develop analytical and interdisciplinary skills. It includes 3 terms of mathematics, 3 terms of physics, 2 terms of chemistry, 1 term of biology, a 1 term “menu” course, 1 term of computer science, a scientific writing requirement, 1 term of physical education, and 11 terms of humanities and social science, with placement exams allowing advanced students to substitute introductory courses and a pass/no-record grading system in the freshman fall term to ease academic pressure.\n[\n99\n]\nPrior to the entering class of 2013, Caltech required students to take a core curriculum of five terms of mathematics, five terms of physics, two terms of chemistry, one term of biology, two terms of lab courses, one term of scientific communication, three terms of physical education, and 12 terms of humanities and social science. Since 2013, only three terms each of mathematics and physics have been required by the institute, with the remaining two terms each required by certain options.\n[\n100\n]\n[\n101\n]\nA typical class is worth 9 academic units and given the extensive core curriculum requirements in addition to individual options' degree requirements, students need to take an average of 40.5 units per term (more than four classes) to graduate in four years. 36 units is the minimum full-time load, 48 units is considered a heavy load, and registrations above 51 units require an overload petition.\n[\n102\n]\nApproximately 20 percent of students double-major.\n[\n103\n]\nThis is achievable since the humanities and social sciences majors have been designed to be done in conjunction with a science major. Although choosing two options in the same division is discouraged, it is still possible.\nFirst-year students are enrolled in first-term classes based upon results of placement exams in math, physics, chemistry, and writing and take all classes in their first two terms on a Pass/Fail basis.\n[\n102\n]\nThere is little competition; collaboration on\nhomework\nis encouraged and the honor system encourages take-home tests and flexible homework schedules.\n[\n104\n]\nCaltech offers co-operative programs with other schools, such as the Pasadena\nArt Center College of Design\nand\nOccidental College\n.\nAccording to a 2018\n[update]\nPayScale\nstudy, Caltech graduates earn a median early career salary of $83,400 and $143,100 mid-career, placing them in the top 5 among graduates of US colleges and universities.\n[\n105\n]\nThe average net return on investment over a period of 20 years is $887,000, the tenth-highest among US colleges.\n[\n106\n]\nCaltech offers Army and Air Force\nROTC\nin cooperation with the\nUniversity of Southern California\n.\n[\n76\n]\nGraduate program\n[\nedit\n]\nDoctoral regalia\nof the California Institute of Technology\nAdmission to Caltech's graduate study is highly competitive, with faculty evaluating factors such as academic preparation, research experience, scientific interests, and recommendations from teachers or mentors.\n[\n107\n]\nA key aspect of the admission process is the matching of faculty and an applicant's research interests. Historically, many programs required applicants to submit GRE scores. However, in recent years, many departments have made the GRE optional or no longer require it at all.\n[\n108\n]\nThe graduate instructional programs emphasize doctoral studies and are dominated by science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.\n[\n73\n]\nThe institute offers graduate degree programs for the Master of Science, Engineer's Degree, Doctor of Philosophy, BS/MS and MD/PhD, with the majority of students in the PhD program.\n[\n73\n]\nThe most popular options are Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Electrical Engineering, and Chemical Engineering.\n[\n98\n]\nInitially, most new graduate students are assigned a temporary advisor, allowing time to select a permanent advisor.\n[\n109\n]\nTo aid in this, some graduate options include rotations in research labs, facilitating a better match with faculty research groups that align with the students' scientific interests. Up to three rotations in the first year are allowed in some options.\nCaltech provides on-campus housing options for incoming graduate students. All new graduate students are guaranteed housing in their first year, with a variety of living experiences available to suit different needs.\n[\n110\n]\nApproximately half of Caltech's graduate student population resides in campus housing. Post-first year, students participate in a housing lottery, with the results announced two months prior to the contract end date, aiding in planning for those who need to seek off-campus housing.\n[\n111\n]\nThe research facilities at Caltech are available to graduate students, but there are opportunities for students to work in facilities of other universities, research centers (such as NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory), and private industries.\n[\n112\n]\nThe graduate student to faculty ratio is 4:1.\n[\n113\n]\nJoint programs also exist between Caltech and the\nKeck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California\n, the\nUCLA David Geffen School of Medicine\n, and the\nKaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine\n, which grants MD/PhD degrees.

Four South Houses (or\nHovses\n, as styled in the stone engravings) were built:\nBlacker House\n,\nDabney House\n,\nFleming House\nand\nRicketts House\n. In the 1960s, three North Houses were built:\nLloyd House\n,\nPage House\n, and\nRuddock House\n, and during the 1990s,\nAvery House\n. The four South Houses closed for renovation in 2005 and reopened in 2006. The latest addition to residential life at Caltech is Bechtel Residence, which opened in 2018. It is not affiliated with the house system.\n[\n151\n]\nAll first- and second-year students live on campus in the house system or in the Bechtel Residence.\n[\n152\n]\nOn account of Albert B. Ruddock's affiliation with the\nHuman Betterment Foundation\n, in January 2021, the Caltech Board of Trustees authorized the removal of Ruddock's name from campus buildings.\n[\n58\n]\nRuddock House was renamed as the Grant D.

The orchestra gives three pairs of concerts annually, at both Caltech and Occidental College. There are also two Caltech Jazz Bands and a Concert Band, as well as an active chamber music program. For vocal music, Caltech has a mixed-voice\nGlee Club\nand the smaller Chamber Singers.\n[\n166\n]\nThe theater program at Caltech is known as TACIT, or Theater Arts at the California Institute of Technology. There are two to three plays organized by TACIT per year, and they were involved in the production of the\nPHD Movie\n, released in 2011.\nStudent life traditions\n[\nedit\n]\nAnnual events\n[\nedit\n]\nEvery\nHalloween\n, Dabney House conducts the infamous \"Millikan pumpkin-drop experiment\" from the top of Millikan Library, the highest point on campus. According to tradition, a claim was once made that the shattering of a pumpkin frozen in\nliquid nitrogen\nand dropped from a sufficient height would produce a\ntriboluminescent\nspark. This yearly event involves a crowd of observers, who try to spot the elusive spark. The title of the event is an oblique reference to the famous\nMillikan oil-drop experiment\nwhich measured\ne\n, the\nelemental unit of electrical charge\n.\nOn Ditch Day, the seniors ditch school, leaving behind elaborately designed tasks and traps at the doors of their rooms to prevent underclassmen from entering. Over the years this has evolved to the point where many seniors spend months designing mechanical, electrical, and software obstacles to confound the underclassmen. Each group of seniors designs a \"stack\" to be solved by a handful of underclassmen. The faculty have been drawn into the event as well, and cancel all classes on Ditch Day so the underclassmen can participate in what has become a highlight of the academic year.\nAnother long-standing tradition is the playing of Wagner's \"\nRide of the Valkyries\n\" at 7:00 each morning during finals week with the largest, loudest speakers available. The playing of that piece is not allowed at any other time (except if one happens to be listening to the entire 14 hours and 5 minutes of\nThe Ring Cycle\n), and any offender is dragged into the showers to be drenched in cold water fully dressed.\nPranks\n[\nedit\n]\nCaltech students have been known for their many\npranks\n(also known as \"RFs\").\n[\n167\n]\nThe two most famous in recent history are the changing of the\nHollywood Sign\nto read \"Caltech\", by judiciously covering up certain parts of the letters, and the changing of the scoreboard to read Caltech 38, MIT 9 during the\n1984 Rose Bowl Game\n. But the most famous of all occurred during the\n1961 Rose Bowl Game\n, where Caltech students altered the flip-cards that were raised by the stadium attendees to display \"Caltech\", and several other \"unintended\" messages. This event is now referred to as the\nGreat Rose Bowl Hoax\n.\nIn recent years, pranking has been officially encouraged by Tom Mannion, Caltech's Assistant VP for Student Affairs and Campus Life. \"The grand old days of pranking have gone away at Caltech, and that's what we are trying to bring back,\" reported the\nBoston Globe\n.\n[\n168\n]\nIn December 2011, Caltech students went to New York and pulled a prank in Manhattan's\nGreenwich Village\n. The prank involved making\nThe Cube\nsculpture look like the\nAperture Science\nWeighted Companion Cube from the video game\nPortal\n.\n[\n169\n]\nCaltech pranks have been documented in three Legends of Caltech books, the most recent of which was edited by alumni Autumn Looijen '99 and\nMason Porter\n'98 and published in May 2007.\nRivalry with MIT\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nCaltech–MIT rivalry\nIn 2005, a group of Caltech students pulled a string of pranks during MIT's Campus Preview Weekend for admitted students. These include covering up the word Massachusetts in the \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" engraving on the main building façade with a banner so that it read \"That Other Institute of Technology\". A group of\nMIT hackers\nresponded by altering the banner so that the inscription read \"The Only Institute of Technology.\" Caltech students also passed out T-shirts to MIT's incoming freshman class that had MIT written on the front and \"...\nbecause not everyone can go to Caltech\" along with an image of a palm tree on the back.\nMIT retaliated in April 2006, when students posing as the Howe & Ser (Howitzer) Moving Company stole the 130-year-old, 1.7-ton Fleming House cannon and moved it over 3,000 miles to their campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts for their 2006 Campus Preview Weekend, repeating a similar prank performed by nearby\nHarvey Mudd College\nin 1986. Thirty members of Fleming House traveled to MIT and reclaimed their cannon on April 10, 2006.\nOn April 13, 2007 (Friday the 13th), a group of students from\nThe California Tech\n, Caltech's campus newspaper, arrived and distributed fake copies of\nThe Tech\n, MIT's campus newspaper, while prospective students were visiting for their Campus Preview Weekend. Articles included \"MIT Invents the Interweb\", \"Architects Deem Campus 'Unfortunate\n'\n\", and \"\nInfinite Corridor\nNot Actually Infinite\".\nIn December 2009, some Caltech students declared that MIT had been sold and had become the Caltech East campus. A \"sold\" banner was hung on front of the MIT dome building and a \"Welcome to Caltech East: School of the Humanities\" banner over the Massachusetts Avenue Entrance. Newspapers and T-shirts were distributed, and door labels and fliers in the infinite corridor were put up in accordance with the \"curriculum change.\"\n[\n170\n]\n[\n171\n]\nIn September 2010, MIT students attempted to put a\nTARDIS\n, the time machine from the BBC's\nDoctor Who\n, onto a roof. Caught in mid-act, the prank was aborted. In January 2011, Caltech students in conjunction with MIT students helped put the TARDIS on top of Baxter.\n[\n172\n]\nCaltech students then moved the TARDIS to\nUC Berkeley\n[\n173\n]\nand\nStanford\n.\n[\n174\n]\nIn April 2014, during MIT's Campus Preview Weekend, a group of Caltech students handed out mugs emblazoned with the MIT logo on the front and the words \"The Institute of Technology\" on the back. When heated, the mugs turn orange, display a palm tree, and read \"Caltech The Hotter Institute of Technology.\" Identical mugs continue to be sold at the Caltech campus store.\n[\n175\n]\nHonor code\n[\nedit\n]\nLife in the Caltech community is governed by the\nhonor code\n, which simply states: \"No member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community.\" This is enforced by a Board of Control, which consists of undergraduate students,\n[\n176\n]\nand by a similar body at the graduate level, called the Graduate Honor Council.\n[\n177\n]\nThe honor code aims at promoting an atmosphere of respect and trust that allows Caltech students to enjoy privileges that make for a more relaxed atmosphere. For example, the honor code allows professors to make the majority of exams as take-home, allowing students to take them on their own schedule and in their preferred environment.\nThrough the late 1990s, the only exception to the honor code, implemented earlier in the decade in response to changes in federal regulations, concerned the sexual harassment policy. Today, there are myriad exceptions to the honor code in the form of new Institute policies such as the fire policy and alcohol policy. Although both policies are presented in the Honor System Handbook given to new members of the Caltech community, some undergraduates regard them as a slight against the honor code and the implicit trust and respect it represents within the community.\n[\n178\n]\nIn recent years, the Student Affairs Office has also taken up pursuing investigations independently of the Board of Control and Conduct Review Committee, an implicit violation of both the honor code and written disciplinary policy that has contributed to further erosion of trust between some parts of the undergraduate community and the administration.\n[\n179\n]\nNotable people\n[\nedit\n]\nFor a more comprehensive list, see\nList of California Institute of Technology people\nand\nList of Nobel laureates affiliated with California Institute of Technology\n.\nAs of October 2025, Caltech has 48\nNobel laureates\nto its name awarded to 26 alumni, 5 postdocs, and 17 non-alumni professors. The 26 alumni include five Caltech professors (\nCarl D. Anderson\n,\nLinus Pauling\n,\nWilliam A. Fowler\n,\nEdward B. Lewis\n, and\nKip Thorne\n). Among the 17 non-alumni professors, 14 were in residence at Caltech at the time of the award;\nDavid Baltimore\n, who shared the Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1975, became Caltech President in 1997;\nRenato Dulbecco\n, who shared the Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1975, credited his Prize to the time he had spent at Caltech;\n[\n180\n]\nJohn Hopfield, who won the Prize in Physics in 2024, is the Dickinson Professor Emeritus at Caltech.\n[\n181\n]\nThe total number of Nobel Prizes is 49 because Pauling received prizes in both\nChemistry\nand\nPeace\n.\n[\n182\n]\nEight faculty and alumni have received a\nCrafoord Prize\nfrom the\nRoyal Swedish Academy of Sciences\n, while 58 have been awarded the U.S.\nNational Medal of Science\n, and 11 have received the\nNational Medal of Technology\n.\n[\n4\n]\nOne alumnus,\nStanislav Smirnov\n, won the\nFields Medal\nin 2010.

The\nTuring Award\n, the \"Nobel Prize of Computer Science\", has been awarded to six alumni, and one has won the\nFields Medal\n.\n[\n184\n]\nMany alumni have participated in scientific research. Some have concentrated their studies on the very small universe of atoms and molecules.\nNobel laureate\nCarl D.

Abell (BS 1951, MS 1952, PhD 1957) while a grad student at Caltech participated in the National Geographic Society-Palomar Sky Survey. This ultimately resulted in the publication of the\nAbell Catalogue of Clusters of Galaxies,\nthe definitive work in the field.\n[\n187\n]\nUndergraduate alumni founded, or co-founded, companies such as\nLCD\nmanufacturer Varitronix,\n[\n188\n]\nHotmail\n,\n[\n189\n]\nCompaq\n,\n[\n190\n]\nMathWorks\n(which created\nMatlab\n),\n[\n191\n]\nand database provider\nImply\n,\n[\n192\n]\nwhile graduate students founded, or co-founded, companies such as\nIntel\n,\n[\n193\n]\nTRW\n,\n[\n194\n]\nand the non-profit educational organization, the\nExploratorium\n.\n[\n195\n]\nArnold Beckman\n(PhD 1928) invented the\npH meter\nand commercialized it with the founding of\nBeckman Instruments\n. His success with that company enabled him to provide seed funding for\nWilliam Shockley\n(BS 1932), who had co-invented\nsemiconductor\ntransistors\nand wanted to commercialize them. Shockley became the founding Director of the\nShockley Semiconductor Laboratory\ndivision of Beckman Instruments.\n[\n196\n]\nShockley had previously worked at\nBell Labs\n, whose first president was another alumnus,\nFrank Jewett\n(BS 1898). Because his aging mother lived in\nPalo Alto, California\n, Shockley established his laboratory near her in\nMountain View, California\n.\n[\n196\n]\n[\n197\n]\nShockley was a co-recipient of the\nNobel Prize in Physics\nin 1956, but his aggressive management style and odd personality\n[\n198\n]\nat the Shockley Lab became unbearable.\n[\n199\n]\nIn late 1957, eight of his researchers resigned and with support from\nSherman Fairchild\nformed\nFairchild Semiconductor\n. Among the \"\ntraitorous eight\n\" was\nGordon E. Moore\n(PhD 1954), who later left Fairchild to co-found\nIntel\n. Other offspring companies of Fairchild Semiconductor include\nNational Semiconductor\nand\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n, which in turn spawned more technology companies in the area. Shockley's decision to use\nsilicon\ninstead of\ngermanium\nas the\nsemiconductor\nmaterial, coupled with the abundance of silicon semiconductor related companies in the area, gave rise to the term \"\nSilicon Valley\n\"\n[\n200\n]\nto describe that geographic region surrounding Palo Alto.\nCaltech alumni also held public offices, with\nMustafa A.

The promotion of physics made him a public figure of science, although his Nobel-winning work in\nquantum electrodynamics\nwas already very established in the scientific community.\nMurray Gell-Mann\n, a Nobel-winning physicist, introduced a classification of\nhadrons\nand went on to postulate the existence of\nquarks\n, which is currently accepted as part of the\nStandard Model\n. Long-time Caltech President\nRobert Andrews Millikan\nwas the first to calculate the charge of the\nelectron\nwith his well-known\noil-drop experiment\n, while\nRichard Chace Tolman\nis remembered for his contributions to\ncosmology\nand\nstatistical mechanics\n. 2004\nNobel Prize in Physics\nwinner\nH. David Politzer\nis a current professor at Caltech, as is astrophysicist and author\nKip Thorne\nand eminent mathematician\nBarry Simon\n.\nLinus Pauling\npioneered\nquantum chemistry\nand\nmolecular biology\n, and went on to discover the nature of the chemical bond in 1939. Seismologist\nCharles Richter\n, also an alumnus, developed the magnitude scale that bears his name, the\nRichter magnitude scale\nfor measuring the power of earthquakes. One of the founders of the geochemistry department,\nClair Patterson\nwas the first to accurately determine the age of the Earth via lead:uranium ratio in meteorites. In engineering,\nTheodore von Kármán\nmade many key advances in aerodynamics, notably his work on\nsupersonic\nand\nhypersonic\nairflow characterization. A repeating pattern of swirling\nvortices\nis named after him, the\nvon Kármán vortex street\n. Participants in von Kármán's GALCIT project included\nFrank Malina\n, who helped develop the\nWAC Corporal\n, which was the first U.S. rocket to reach the edge of space,\nJack Parsons\n, a pioneer in the development of liquid and solid rocket fuels who designed the first castable composite-based rocket motor, and\nQian Xuesen\n, who was dubbed the \"Father of Chinese Rocketry\". More recently,\nMichael Brown\n, a professor of planetary astronomy, discovered many\ntrans-Neptunian objects\n, most notably the\ndwarf planet\nEris\n, which prompted the\nInternational Astronomical Union\nto redefine the term \"\nplanet\n\".\nDavid Baltimore\n, the Robert A. Millikan Professor of Biology, and\nAlice Huang\n, Senior Faculty Associate in Biology, served as the presidents of\nAAAS\nfrom 2007 to 2008 and 2010 to 2011, respectively.\n[\n202\n]\n33% of the faculty are members of the\nNational Academy of Sciences\nor\nEngineering\nand/or fellows of the\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences\n. This is the highest percentage of any faculty in the country with the exception of the graduate institution\nRockefeller University\n.\n[\n203\n]\nThe average salary for assistant professors at Caltech is $111,300, associate professors $121,300, and full professors $172,800.\n[\n204\n]\nCaltech faculty are active in applied physics, astronomy and astrophysics, biology, biochemistry, biological engineering, chemical engineering, computer science, geology, mechanical engineering, and physics.\n[\n205\n]\nPresidents\n[\nedit\n]\nThe following persons have led Caltech, known as Throop before 1921.\n[\n206\n]\nThe numbering is made to be consistent with Caltech's announcement: \"Ray Jayawardhana Appointed Caltech's Tenth President.\"\n[\n207\n]\nNo.\nImage\nName\nTerm start\nTerm end\nField\nRefs.\n–\nCharles Henry Keyes\n1892\n1896\n[\na\n]\nEducation\n[\n208\n]\n–\nWalter Alison Edwards\n1897\nJune 30, 1907\n[\nb\n]\nClassics\n[\n209\n]\n[\n210\n]\nacting\nArthur Henry Chamberlain\nJuly 1, 1907\nSeptember 30, 1908\nEducation\n[\n211\n]\n1\nJames A.

Through its Office of Technology Transfer & Corporate Partnerships,\n[\n235\n]\nscientific breakthroughs have led to the transfer of numerous technologies in a wide variety of scientific-related fields such as\nphotovoltaic\n,\nradio-frequency identification\n(RFID),\nsemiconductors\n,\nhyperspectral imaging\n,\nelectronic devices\n,\nprotein\ndesign, solid state amplifiers and many more.\n[\n236\n]\nCompanies such as\nQuora\n, Contour Energy Systems,\nImpinj\n, Fulcrum Microsystems, Nanosys, Inc.,\nPhoton etc.\n,\nXencor\n, and Wavestream Wireless\n[\n237\n]\nhave emerged from Caltech.\nIn media and popular culture\n[\nedit\n]\nCaltech has appeared in many works of popular culture, both as itself and in disguised form. On television, it played a prominent role and was the workplace of all four\nmale lead characters and one female lead character\nin the sitcom\nThe Big Bang Theory\n. Caltech is also the inspiration, and frequent film location, for the California Institute of Science in\nNumb3rs\n.\n[\n238\n]\nOn film, the Pacific Tech of\nThe War of the Worlds\n[\n239\n]\nand\nReal Genius\n[\n238\n]\nis based on Caltech.\nIn nonfiction, two 2007 documentaries examine aspects of Caltech:\nCurious\n, its researchers,\n[\n240\n]\n[\n241\n]\nand\nQuantum Hoops\n, its men's basketball team.\nCaltech is also prominently featured in many comics and television series by\nMarvel Entertainment\n. In\nMarvel Comics\n, the university serves as the alma mater of\nHulk\n,\nMister Fantastic\n,\nBill Foster\n(Black Goliath), and\nMadman\n.\n[\n242\n]\nIn the\nMarvel Cinematic Universe\n,\nBruno Carrelli\n(\nKamala Khan\n's best friend and love interest) attends Caltech in the miniseries\nMs. Marvel\n.\n[\n243\n]\nGiven its Los Angeles-area location, the grounds of the Institute are often host to short scenes in movies and television. The\nAthenaeum dining club\nappears in the\nBeverly Hills Cop\nseries\n,\nThe X-Files\n,\nTrue Romance\n, and\nThe West Wing\n.\n[\n244\n]\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nCalifornia portal\nEngineering education\nUS-China University Presidents Roundtable\nNotes\n[\nedit\n]\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\n\"History & Milestones\"\n.\n^\n\"Caltech: Did you know?\"\n.

Before the opening of Stevenson, the students in the Stevenson area attended\nEla-Vernon High School\nin Lake Zurich. Stevenson was planned to be a second school for the growing district, but the western side (Lake Zurich) of the district decided to build their own district. Adlai E. Stevenson High School opened in September 1965.\n[\n5\n]\nThis left Stevenson with an unfinished building, no board or administration, and no faculty. When Stevenson opened to 467 students and 31 teachers in 1965, the building was not carpeted, the library was empty, most classrooms were without desks and athletic fields were non-existent, as most of the school furniture had been shipped to\nPrairie View, Texas\ninstead of\nPrairie View, Illinois\n.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n5\n]\nIn the 1980s, the release of \"A Nation at Risk\" and the arrival of\nRichard DuFour\nas school principal marked pivotal events. During the 1980s and 1990s, the school's student activities program expanded, providing over 100 clubs and teams for students. By the late 1990s, intense student competition led to the formation of a task force to find solutions to issues like grading system manipulation. In 1992, a community referendum determined that Stevenson would remain the district's only high school, with 52% supporting this option. In 1995, Stevenson underwent its largest expansion, growing by more than 50% with a $25 million project.\n[\n5\n]\nStevenson has grown since its opening to become one of the largest high schools in the area.\n[\n7\n]\nThe school has undergone various additions over the years, the first being in 1970 where the school gym and pool were renovated. To accommodate the increasing student population, another round of remodeling occurred in the mid-1990s. After the addition of the three-level east building in 1995, the physical size of SHS increased to more than six times its original size of 113,000 square feet. The new east building included 60 new classrooms, a new Performing Arts Center (PAC), the Patriot Aquatic Center, Field House, and the Technology Center, among other projects as well. Also built was a new indoor walkway (\"The Link\") between the original west building and the new east building.\nIn 2002, a referendum seeking an increase in the education tax rate received nearly 70% support from the community, stabilizing the district's finances. Since 2002, DuFour's retirement year, he had become a leading voice for school reform within the education community until his death in 2017.\n[\n8\n]\nIn April 2008,\nEducation Week\nfeatured Stevenson High School in an article about its successful implementation of professional learning community practices.\n[\n5\n]\nIn 2004, the main entrance to the school was completely rebuilt and transformed into another commons area now known as \"The Point.\" Other renovations that year included more fine arts areas around the band, choir, and orchestra rooms in the west building.\n[\n9\n]\nAround 2008, many of the athletic fields were expanded and the football field received new turf. In that same year, the original auditorium was renovated as well.\n[\n10\n]\nIn the 2005–06 school year, Stevenson had its highest enrollment of 4,573 students. Between the 2005–06 and 2014–15 school years, each school year saw progressively declining enrollment in the student body. In the 2014–15 school year, Stevenson had its first enrollment increase since the peak in the 2005–06 school year.\n[\n11\n]\nStevenson's enrollment was 4,337 for the 2018–19 school year,\n[\n12\n]\nand enrollment surpassed 4500 by 2020.\nIn 2011, the school library and student resource center in the old/west building were renovated for the first time in Stevenson's history. The project was finished in 2015 when the removal of the two lecture halls was completed to make way for the Quiet Learning Center (QLC).\n[\n13\n]\nIn addition to the new ILC/QLC, the photography studio was also renovated in the summer of 2013.\nIn 2019, the school added an extension to the east building, including 22 new classrooms, conference rooms, a\ngreen roof\nand flower garden, multiple\nliving walls\nand solar panels, with the intent of making the new addition a\nnet-zero building\n.\n[\n14\n]\nIn 2020, Stevenson began planning for an additional expansion, with new athletic courts, an artificial turf playing field, a larger running track, an area for exercise equipment, and other features to be built in the enlarged field house.\n[\n15\n]\nThis addition was finished in August 2022.\nDemographics\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 2023, the demographics were: White: 46.6%, Asian: 39.3%, Hispanic: 9.0%, Black: 1.7%, Two or More Races: 3.2%, and American Indian: 0.2%.\n[\n16\n]\nCommunities served\n[\nedit\n]\nThe school serves students in the area's District 125 coming from\nLincolnshire\n,\nLong Grove\n,\nPrairie View\n, portions of\nBuffalo Grove\n,\nMundelein\n,\nKildeer\n,\nHawthorn Woods\nand smaller portions of\nVernon Hills\n,\nLake Zurich\n,\nRiverwoods\n,\nBannockburn\n,  and\nMettawa\n.\n[\n17\n]\n[\n18\n]\nFeeder schools\n[\nedit\n]\nPublic schools\n[\nedit\n]\nName of feeder school\nName of feeder school's school district\nDaniel Wright Junior High School\n[\n19\n]\nLincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103\nAptakisic Junior High School\n[\n19\n]\n[\n20\n]\nAptakisic-Tripp School District 102\nTwin Groves Middle School\n[\n19\n]\nKildeer Consolidated School District 96\nWoodlawn Middle School\n[\n19\n]\nFremont Middle School\n[\n19\n]\nFremont School District 79\nWest Oak Middle School\n[\n19\n]\nDiamond Lake School District 76\nControversies and incidents\n[\nedit\n]\nNewspaper censorship\n[\nedit\n]\nIn November 2009, a dispute erupted between school officials and the student newspaper,\nThe Statesman\n, regarding censorship of stories. The administration stopped publication of the November 20 issue, objecting to stories regarding drugs, teen pregnancy, and shoplifting. When students wanted to leave the front page blank in protest of the censorship, the officials instead required the students to produce other stories approved by the administration.\n[\n21\n]\n[\n22\n]\nThe Stevenson public information officer released a statement November 20 stating the administration did not think anonymous sources discussing alleged illegal activity was fit for print.\n[\n23\n]\nThe Chicago Tribune, in a November 26 editorial, said the school was wrong to force students to produce administration-approved stories. \"This isn't editing, it's censorship,\" wrote columnist Zak Stambor.\n[\n24\n]\nThe Society of Professional Journalists' Freedom of Information chairman called the censorship \"immoral, un-American, irresponsible and not fit for education.\"\n[\n25\n]\nFollowing the censorship fiasco, 11 of 14 Statesman staffers — and all the paper's top editors — resigned from their positions at the start of the spring 2010 semester.\n[\n26\n]\nConfiscation of student cellphones\n[\nedit\n]\nIn February 2012, the school administration initiated an investigation into marijuana sales at the school, during which the cellphones of students suspected of marijuana sales were confiscated, and the text messages stored on the phones were read.  The American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois described the incident as a \"\nfishing expedition\n\", while school officials stated they were \"perfectly within our rights\".  In one instance a student was suspended for five days and barred from participating in extracurricular activities because he refused to provide the password to his cellphone.  The probe resulted in two arrests on misdemeanor drug charges.\n[\n27\n]\n[\n28\n]\nStudent altercations\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 2017, three female students were put on academic suspension when a video surfaced of a student attacking another student on a bus. The student was later charged in juvenile court for aggravated battery.\n[\n29\n]\nDiscrimination against Black students\n[\nedit\n]\nIn January 2020, a black student at Stevenson was allegedly targeted and disrespected by dean Nick Valenziano on a recorded video. This led to student protesting and an uproar in the Stevenson community. School administrators accepted Valenziano's resignation around June 2020,\n[\n30\n]\nand hired a diversity director to address racial issues within the school.\n[\n31\n]\nAthletics\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Stevenson Patriots compete in the\nNorth Suburban Conference\n.\n[\n32\n]\nThe following is a list of sports Stevenson lists for the 2023–24 school year:\n[\n33\n]\nBadminton\nBaseball\nBasketball\nBass Fishing\nBowling\nCheerleading\nCross Country\nSideline Dance\nFencing\nField Hockey\nFootball\nFlag Football\nGolf\nGymnastics\nIce hockey\nLacrosse\nPatriettes (\nDance squad\n)\nSoccer\nSoftball\nSwimming\nTennis\nTrack and Field\nVolleyball\nWater Polo\nWrestling\nStevenson High School is a member of the\nIHSA\n, the athletic teams are stylized as the Patriots.

While the school has a Katy address, it is within the\nextraterritorial jurisdiction\nof\nHouston\n, and is a high school of the\nKaty Independent School District\n(KISD).\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThe school was originally planned by\nKaty ISD\nto relieve overcrowding at\nCinco Ranch High School\nand\nKaty High School\nand to better facilitate the influx of students due to new development planned in the general Katy area. The school plan was the same general design used for two other\nKISD\nschools,\nMorton Ranch High School\nand\nCinco Ranch High School\n, and was designed by\nPBK Architects\n. The school's first year in operation was the 2005–2006 school year and had its first graduating class of 408 students in the 2007–2008 school year.\n[\n4\n]\nThe school was nominated a \"\nNational Blue Ribbon School\nof 2008.\"\n[\n5\n]\nCOVID-19\n[\nedit\n]\nIn March 2020, in accordance with the rest of the schools in the\nKaty Independent School District\n, classes, campus events, field trips, student trips and competitions were postponed as a result of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic in Texas.\n[\n6\n]\nOn April 17, the school was\nshut down\nfor the rest of the academic school year in accordance with Gov.\nGreg Abbott\n’s orders.\n[\n7\n]\nVirtual learning was put in place using\nCanvas\n, and was extended throughout the 2020-2021 school year during which two options were offered for returning students. The first involved in-person instruction, combining face-to-face teaching with digital learning through Canvas, including daily attendance tracking. The second option, the Katy Virtual Academy (KVA), offered real-time, live instruction via\nCanvas\n, allowing students to follow the KISD curriculum and meet Texas graduation requirements. Both in-person and virtual students adhered to the same grading guidelines, but the attendance requirement for the fall 2020 final exam eligibility was waived, allowing high school students to exempt a final exam if they met semester average and behavior requirements.\n[\n8\n]\nA temporary closure occurred on October 30, due to 43 students testing positive for coronavirus. Following a Corrective Action Advisement from the Fort Bend County Health and Human Services Department, the closure involved providing intermittent virtual learning for in-person students until November 3, with a planned return to in-person learning for both students and staff on November 4.\n[\n9\n]\nSchools were reopened in person for the 2021-2022 school year.\n[\n10\n]\nBackground\n[\nedit\n]\nThe school is located in the\nKaty Independent School District\n, and has the distinction of being the largest high school construction project at one time in the state of\nTexas\n.\n[\n11\n]\nSeven Lakes was designed by\nPBK Architects\n, as were many other area schools.\n[\n12\n]\nIt was also the second largest, as well as the most expensive, school in the United States when it was opened. The total cost of the school came around to $77,424,704 after construction was complete.\n[\n12\n]\nThe name of the school is derived from two major communities that are zoned to it, Seven Meadows and Grand Lakes, taking \"Seven\" from the name of the Seven Meadows community and \"Lakes\" from the name of the Grand Lakes community.\n[\n13\n]\nWhile the school is meant only for a maximum of 3,000 students, as with many other schools in\nKatyISD\n, it quickly became overcrowded due to the rapid development in the area. Seven Lakes reached its peak of 3,957 students in 2012 before many students were zoned to\nTompkins High School\n.\nThe school maintains a rivalry of sorts with\nCinco Ranch High School\n, another high school also located in the same school district as Seven Lakes (\nKaty Independent School District\n) and located 3 miles away.\n[\n14\n]\nLogically, much of the area now zoned to Seven Lakes was originally zoned to\nCinco Ranch High School\nbefore Seven Lakes opened, and much of the area zoned to the new\nTompkins High School\nwas previously zoned to Seven Lakes.\nDemographics\n[\nedit\n]\nAs of 2023–2024, the school's demographics were:\n[\n15\n]\nNative American/ Alaskan Nat: 0.3%\nAsian: 33.5%\nBlack: 7.4%\nHispanic/Latino: 24.1%\nWhite: 31.1%\nTwo or More Races: 3.6%\nCampus\n[\nedit\n]\nGilbane Building Co\n. built the school and\nPBK Architects\ndesigned the school.\n[\n16\n]\nThe school has the following facilities:\n[\n17\n]\n615,000 square feet (57,100 m\n2\n)\nNatatorium with diving equipment\n9 tennis courts\nWeight lifting room\nAux.

It is the only high school in the district, and is the successor to both\nWellwood Middle School\nand\nEagle Hill Middle School\n. The school is governed under the authority of the\nNew York State Education Department\n, whose\nstandardized examinations\nare designed and administered by the\nBoard of Regents\nof the\nUniversity of the State of New York\n.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nFayetteville–Manlius High School was opened in 1963 after the 1951 merger of then separate Fayetteville and Manlius school districts and subsequent need to consolidate students into a single high school. Upon this opening, a major school restructuring was implemented, as the Fayetteville High School became\nWellwood Middle School\nand Manlius High School became Pleasant Street Elementary (which closed in 1975). A new\nmiddle school\n,\nEagle Hill\n, was also opened directly next to the high school in 1965. Space requirements, due mainly to ballooning enrollment and continued reorganization as a result of the 1951 merger, prompted the district to relocate Eagle Hill to a new building on a new campus in 1972, so the high school could expand into the junior high's previous facilities. This expansion, which connected the two buildings, now called House 2 and House 1, by a hallway and an enclosed footbridge, nearly doubled the school's footprint. F-M High School served grades 12 through 10 until 1976, when the two junior high schools became middle schools, and FM High took in 9th graders.\n[\n2\n]\nAdministration\n[\nedit\n]\nFormer principal of Mott Road Elementary School and vice principal of Fayetteville–Manlius High School itself, Patrick McNamara was selected to replace interim principal John Durkee, himself replacing longtime principal Raymond W. Kilmer, III (now superintendent of\nOswego City School District\n), and legally began his reign on July 1, 2024.\n[\n3\n]\nTraditions\n[\nedit\n]\nMany of the school's traditions stem from the fact that decades ago, hornets nested in a 200-year-old oak tree that formerly stood on the old high school campus (now Wellwood Middle School).\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\nBecause of this, the athletic teams' mascots are the Hornets, and several of the names used for the school newspaper over the years have been hornet-related (see Extracurriculars, below).\nThe school\nalma mater\ngives tribute to the original tree in its opening\nstanza\n, \"Guarded by the old oak tree...\".  The alma mater is set to the melody of \"\nAura Lee\n\". Its lyrics are attributed to teacher Richard Rhoades \"and his music composition class\".\n[\n6\n]\nThe motif can also be seen in the school colors (green and white), in the district\nlogo\n, and in the name of the school yearbook (\nOakleaves\n).\nDemographics\n[\nedit\n]\nThere are currently 1,405 students\n[\n7\n]\nenrolled at F-M High School and 130 faculty members, for a student-teacher ratio of approximately 14:1.\nAs of the 2005–06 school year, the racial/ethnic makeup of the student population was 91.8%\nWhite\n, 2.7%\nBlack\nor\nAfrican American\n, 4.4%\nAsian\nor\nPacific Islander\n, and 0.8%\nHispanic\n. Approximately 0.5% of the population, or 8 students, demonstrated limited English proficiency. Approximately 0.8% of students qualified for a reduced-price lunch, and another 3.5% were eligible for a free lunch. Since then the Asian student population has increased significantly, and now makes up almost 10% of the school's population.\nAcademics and extracurriculars\n[\nedit\n]\nCurriculum\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section\nneeds additional citations for\nverification\n.\nPlease help\nimprove this article\nby\nadding citations to reliable sources\nin this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.\n(\nOctober 2025\n)\n(\nLearn how and when to remove this message\n)\nThe school focuses on graduating all students with the minimum of a\nRegents Diploma\n, but some may also graduate with a less advanced local diploma. The\nRegents Diploma with Advanced Designation\nmay be achieved with extended studies in a foreign language.\nThough the curriculum is developed and sanctioned by the\nNew York State Department of Education\n, and classes are developed to prepare students to achieve success on the required\nRegents Examinations\n, most core courses offer one or two components that explore more advanced topics. The school offers standard level Regents courses, but also offers more advanced Honors courses, Interdisciplinary courses (in English and History),\nAdvanced Placement\n(AP) courses, as well as\nSyracuse University\ncourses offered through\nSyracuse University Project Advance\n(SUPA). SU courses offered through Project Advance are taught at the high school by F-M faculty members (qualified by the university), and follow the same curriculum and are given the same credit\n[\n8\n]\nas courses taught at the university. A large percentage of students opt to take SU courses offered through Project Advance instead of AP classes because their equally challenging curriculum is often more widely accepted for transfer credit by the students' successive colleges or universities.\nF-M is part of an extremely small percentage in the country that does not rank students publicly with the exception of awarding\nvaledictorian\nto a graduating senior. The school also uses a 100\ngrade point\nscale, as opposed to the much more common 4.0 scale, and weighs the GPA based on class difficulty level (Regents, Honors, AP, etc.). In addition, the athletic department does not participate in academic\nAll-America\nhonors.\nNotable achievements\n[\nedit\n]\nScience Olympiad National Champions in 2004\nOther National Finishes: 3rd Place: 2005. 4th Place: 2000,\n[\n9\n]\n2001, 2006,\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\n2007,\n[\n12\n]\n5th Place: 2009\n[\n13\n]\nNew York State Championships in ten consecutive years 2003–2012, 2014, and 2018.\n[\n14\n]\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\n2005 gold medal and 2006 blue ribbon,\nExpansion Management\nmagazine's Education Quotient\n[\n17\n]\n1999, 2000, and 2006 GRAMMY Signature School\n[\n18\n]\nSix-times named one of the American Music Conference's \"Best 100 Communities for Music Education in America\".\n[\n19\n]\nThe high school is consistently honored by the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards as having one of the best art programs in the country.\n[\n20\n]\nIn 2006, students from the high school received a record number of national awards, including the prestigious National American Vision Award.\n[\n21\n]\nThe district consistently exceeds average state and national performances on the\nSAT\n.

Student-run publications include the\nOakleaves\nyearbook, the student newspaper called\nThe Buzz\n(formerly\nThe Sting\n, formerly the\nHornet's Nest\n), and a literary magazine,\nVoices\n.\nThe school has a Quizbowl team (which has appeared in International Academic Competitions' National History Bowl in\nCrystal City, Virginia\n) and Amnesty International Club. Fayetteville-Manlius also boasts a Model United Nations club with more than a hundred participants. The club hosts an annual Central New York MUN Conference (CNYMUN), often inviting over a thousand delegates from around New York.  Another extracurricular area in which the Hornets excel is Mock Trial, where in 2016, Fayetteville–Manlius High School won the New York State Mock Trial Championship with an undefeated season record.\n[\n27\n]\nIn 2020, they placed third in the same competition.\nThe school has a chamber orchestra, string orchestra, concert orchestra, symphony orchestra, jazz ensemble, two bands, concert band, and wind ensemble as well as a very powerful Pep Band, and three vocal groups: choir, the select group's chorale, and Swing 16. The school also has the top Ukulele Ensemble in the Central New York area.\n[\n28\n]\nFM also has three major stage productions during the year. The final production of the year, called\nShowboat\n, is the annual student-run talent show, a tradition reaching back several decades. Fayetteville–Manlius High School also hosts a π memorization contest, which along with other events, culminates in an annual assembly called \"pi day\", which typically takes place on March 14 (the date signifies the first three digits of pi.)

Together, these labs contain almost 200 computers, in addition to around 10 student accessible computers in every classroom.\nIn 2000, to accommodate the school's nationally renowned, award-winning\nart\nprograms, the district opened one of the most extensive art facilities of any public school system in\nUpstate New York\n. The new wing includes classrooms and studio space for\ndrawing\n,\npainting\n,\nceramics\n,\nsculpture\n, and\ndigital media\n.

In the case of a journal reference,\nVVVV\nis the volume number,\nM\nindicates the section of the journal where the reference was published (e.g.,\nL\nfor a letters section),\nPPPP\ngives the starting page number, and\nA\nis the first letter of the last name of the first author. Periods (\n.\n) are used to fill unused fields and to pad fields out to their fixed length if too short; padding is done on the right for the publication code and on the left for the volume number and page number.\n[\n1\n]\n[\n2\n]\nPage numbers greater than 9999 are continued in the\nM\ncolumn. The 6-digit article ID numbers (in lieu of page numbers) used by the Physical Review publications since the late 1990s are treated as follows: The first two digits of the article ID, corresponding to the issue number, are converted to a lower-case letter (01 = a, etc.) and inserted into column\nM\n. The remaining four digits are used in the page field.\n[\n2\n]\nAs many publishers are moving away from page numbers and using electronic identifiers more and more frequently, the page field is no longer guaranteed to be numeric. Often an identifier of more than 5 digits is truncated, and there may be letters, periods, dashes, or other characters in the page field as well. The volume field may also contain non-numeric characters. Modern bibcodes are likely to be deprecated in the future, and users should not depend on semantic meaning represented in the bibcode. For the most current information on bibcodes, see the help text\n[\n3\n]\nfor ADS.\n[\n4\n]\nExamples\n[\nedit\n]\nSome examples of bibcodes are:\nBibcode\nReference\n1974AJ.....79..819H\nHeintz, W.

In contrast,\npathological\nstate\nrefers to\nabnormal conditions\n, including human\ndiseases\n.\nThe\nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\nis awarded by the\nRoyal Swedish Academy of Sciences\nfor exceptional scientific achievements in physiology related to the field of\nmedicine\n.\nFoundations\n[\nedit\n]\nBecause physiology focuses on the functions and mechanisms of living organisms at all levels, from the molecular and cellular level to the level of whole organisms and populations, its foundations span a range of key disciplines:\nAnatomy\nis the study of the structure and organization of living organisms, from the microscopic level of cells and tissues to the macroscopic level of organs and systems. Anatomical knowledge is important in physiology because the structure and function of an organism are often dictated by one another.\nBiochemistry\nis the study of the chemical processes and substances that occur within living organisms. Knowledge of biochemistry provides the foundation for understanding cellular and molecular processes that are essential to the functioning of organisms.\nBiophysics\nis the study of the physical properties of living organisms and their interactions with their environment. It helps to explain how organisms sense and respond to different stimuli, such as light, sound, and temperature, and how they maintain homeostasis, or a stable internal environment.\nGenetics\nis the study of heredity and the variation of traits within and between populations. It provides insights into the genetic basis of physiological processes and the ways in which genes interact with the environment to influence an organism's phenotype.\nEvolutionary biology\nis the study of the processes that have led to the diversity of life on Earth. It helps to explain the origin and adaptive significance of physiological processes and the ways in which organisms have evolved to cope with their environment.\nSubdisciplines\n[\nedit\n]\nThere are many ways to categorize the subdisciplines of physiology:\n[\n6\n]\nbased on the\ntaxa\nstudied:\nhuman physiology\n, animal physiology,\nplant physiology\n, microbial physiology, viral physiology\nbased on the\nlevel of organization\n:\ncell physiology\n,\nmolecular physiology\n,\nsystems\nphysiology, organismal physiology,\necological physiology\n, integrative physiology\nbased on the process that causes physiological variation:\ndevelopmental\nphysiology,\nenvironmental physiology\n,\nevolutionary physiology\nbased on the ultimate goals of the research:\napplied physiology\n(e.g., medical physiology),\nnon-applied\n(e.g.,\ncomparative physiology\n)\nSubdisciplines by level of organisation\n[\nedit\n]\nCell physiology\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nCell physiology\nAlthough there are differences between\nanimal\n,\nplant\n, and microbial cells, the basic physiological functions of cells can be divided into the processes of\ncell division\n,\ncell signaling\n,\ncell growth\n, and\ncell metabolism\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nSubdisciplines by taxa\n[\nedit\n]\nPlant physiology\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nPlant physiology\nPlant physiology is a subdiscipline of\nbotany\nconcerned with the functioning of plants. Closely related fields include\nplant morphology\n,\nplant ecology\n,\nphytochemistry\n,\ncell biology\n,\ngenetics\n,\nbiophysics\n, and\nmolecular biology\n. Fundamental processes of\nplant physiology\ninclude\nphotosynthesis\n,\nrespiration\n,\nplant nutrition\n,\ntropisms\n,\nnastic movements\n,\nphotoperiodism\n,\nphotomorphogenesis\n,\ncircadian rhythms\n,\nseed germination\n,\ndormancy\n, and\nstomata\nfunction and\ntranspiration\n. Absorption of water by roots, production of food in the leaves, and growth of shoots towards light are examples of plant physiology.\n[\n7\n]\nAnimal physiology\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nBiology § Animal form and function\nHuman physiology\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nHuman body § Physiology\nHuman physiology is the study of how the human body's systems and functions work together to maintain a stable internal environment. It includes the study of the nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, and urinary systems, as well as cellular and exercise physiology. Understanding human physiology is essential for diagnosing and treating health conditions and promoting overall wellbeing.\nIt seeks to understand the mechanisms that work to keep the\nhuman body\nalive and functioning,\n[\n4\n]\nthrough scientific enquiry into the nature of mechanical, physical, and biochemical functions of humans, their organs, and the cells of which they are composed. The principal level of focus of physiology is at the level of organs and systems within systems. The endocrine and nervous systems play major roles in the reception and transmission of signals that integrate function in animals.\nHomeostasis\nis a major aspect with regard to such interactions within plants as well as animals. The biological basis of the study of physiology, integration refers to the overlap of many functions of the systems of the human body, as well as its accompanied form. It is achieved through communication that occurs in a variety of ways, both electrical and chemical.\n[\n8\n]\nChanges in physiology can impact the mental functions of individuals. Examples of this would be the effects of certain medications or toxic levels of substances.\n[\n9\n]\nChange in\nbehavior\nas a result of these substances is often used to assess the health of individuals.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\nMuch of the foundation of knowledge in human physiology was provided by\nanimal experimentation\n. Due to the frequent connection between form and function, physiology and\nanatomy\nare intrinsically linked and are studied in tandem as part of a medical curriculum.\n[\n12\n]\nSubdisciplines by research objective\n[\nedit\n]\nComparative physiology\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nComparative physiology\nInvolving\nevolutionary physiology\nand\nenvironmental physiology\n, comparative physiology considers the diversity of functional characteristics across organisms.\n[\n13\n]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThe classical era\n[\nedit\n]\nThe study of human physiology as a medical field originates in\nclassical Greece\n, at the time of\nHippocrates\n(late 5th century BC).\n[\n14\n]\nOutside of Western tradition, early forms of physiology or anatomy can be reconstructed as having been present at around the same time in\nChina\n,\n[\n15\n]\nIndia\n[\n16\n]\nand elsewhere. Hippocrates incorporated the theory of\nhumorism\n, which consisted of four basic substances: earth, water, air and fire. Each substance is known for having a corresponding humor: black bile, phlegm, blood, and yellow bile, respectively. Hippocrates also noted some emotional connections to the four humors, on which\nGalen\nwould later expand. The critical thinking of\nAristotle\nand his emphasis on the relationship between structure and function marked the beginning of physiology in\nAncient Greece\n. Like\nHippocrates\n, Aristotle took to the humoral theory of disease, which also consisted of four primary qualities in life: hot, cold, wet and dry.\n[\n17\n]\nGalen (\nc.\n130\n–200 AD) was the first to use experiments to probe the functions of the body. Unlike Hippocrates, Galen argued that humoral imbalances can be located in specific organs, including the entire body.\n[\n18\n]\nGalen also played off of Hippocrates' idea that emotions were also tied to the humors, and added the notion of temperaments: sanguine corresponds with blood; phlegmatic is tied to phlegm; yellow bile is connected to choleric; and black bile corresponds with melancholy. Galen also saw the human body consisting of three connected systems: the brain and nerves, which are responsible for thoughts and sensations; the heart and arteries, which give life; and the liver and veins, which can be attributed to nutrition and growth.\n[\n18\n]\nGalen was also the founder of experimental physiology.\n[\n19\n]\nAnd for the next 1,400 years, Galenic physiology was a powerful and influential tool in\nmedicine\n.\n[\n18\n]\nEarly modern period\n[\nedit\n]\nJean Fernel\n(1497–1558), a French physician, introduced the term \"physiology\".\n[\n20\n]\nGalen,\nIbn al-Nafis\n,\nMichael Servetus\n,\nRealdo Colombo\n,\nAmato Lusitano\nand\nWilliam Harvey\n, are credited as making important discoveries in the\ncirculation of the blood\n.\n[\n21\n]\nSantorio Santorio\nin 1610s was the first to use a device to measure the\npulse\nrate (the\npulsilogium\n), and a\nthermoscope\nto measure temperature.\n[\n22\n]\nIn 1791\nLuigi Galvani\ndescribed the role of electricity in the nerves of dissected frogs. In 1811,\nCésar Julien Jean Legallois\nstudied respiration in animal dissection and lesions and found the center of respiration in the\nmedulla oblongata\n. In the same year,\nCharles Bell\nfinished work on what would later become known as the\nBell–Magendie law\n, which compared functional differences between dorsal and ventral roots of the\nspinal cord\n. In 1824,\nFrançois Magendie\ndescribed the sensory roots and produced the first evidence of the cerebellum's role in\nequilibration\nto complete the Bell–Magendie law.\nIn the 1820s, the French physiologist\nHenri Milne-Edwards\nintroduced the notion of physiological division of labor, which allowed to \"compare and study living things as if they were machines created by the industry of man.\" Inspired in the work of\nAdam Smith\n, Milne-Edwards wrote that the \"body of all living beings, whether animal or plant, resembles a factory ... where the organs, comparable to workers, work incessantly to produce the phenomena that constitute the life of the individual.\" In more differentiated organisms, the functional labor could be apportioned between different instruments or\nsystems\n(called by him as\nappareils\n).\n[\n23\n]\nIn 1858,\nJoseph Lister\nstudied the cause of blood coagulation and inflammation that resulted after previous injuries and surgical wounds. He later discovered and implemented\nantiseptics\nin the operating room, and as a result, decreased the death rate from surgery by a substantial amount.\n[\n24\n]\nThe Physiological Society\nwas founded in London in 1876 as a dining club.\n[\n25\n]\nThe American Physiological Society\n(APS) is a nonprofit organization that was founded in 1887. The Society is, \"devoted to fostering education, scientific research, and dissemination of information in the physiological sciences.\"\n[\n26\n]\nIn 1891,\nIvan Pavlov\nperformed research on \"conditional responses\" that involved dogs' saliva production in response to a bell and visual stimuli.\n[\n24\n]\nIn the 19th century, physiological knowledge began to accumulate at a rapid rate, in particular with the 1838 appearance of the\nCell theory\nof\nMatthias Schleiden\nand\nTheodor Schwann\n.\n[\n27\n]\nIt radically stated that organisms are made up of units called cells.\nClaude Bernard\n's (1813–1878) further discoveries ultimately led to his concept of\nmilieu interieur\n(internal environment),\n[\n28\n]\n[\n29\n]\nwhich would later be taken up and championed as \"\nhomeostasis\n\" by American physiologist\nWalter B. Cannon\nin 1929. By homeostasis, Cannon meant \"the maintenance of steady states in the body and the physiological processes through which they are regulated.\"\n[\n30\n]\nIn other words, the body's ability to regulate its internal environment. William Beaumont was the first American to utilize the practical application of physiology.\nNineteenth-century physiologists such as\nMichael Foster\n,\nMax Verworn\n, and\nAlfred Binet\n, based on\nHaeckel\n's ideas, elaborated what came to be called \"general physiology\", a unified science of life based on the cell actions,\n[\n23\n]\nlater renamed in the 20th century as\ncell biology\n.\n[\n31\n]\nLate modern period\n[\nedit\n]\nIn the 20th century, biologists became interested in how organisms other than human beings function, eventually spawning the fields of\ncomparative physiology\nand\necophysiology\n.\n[\n32\n]\nMajor figures in these fields include\nKnut Schmidt-Nielsen\nand\nGeorge Bartholomew\n. Most recently,\nevolutionary physiology\nhas become a distinct subdiscipline.\n[\n33\n]\nIn 1920,\nAugust Krogh\nwon the Nobel Prize for discovering how, in capillaries, blood flow is regulated.\n[\n24\n]\nIn 1954,\nAndrew Huxley\nand Hugh Huxley, alongside their research team, discovered the sliding filaments in\nskeletal muscle\n, known today as the sliding filament theory.\n[\n24\n]\nRecently, there have been intense debates about the vitality of physiology as a discipline (Is it dead or alive?).\n[\n34\n]\n[\n35\n]\nIf physiology is perhaps less visible nowadays than during the golden age of the 19th century,\n[\n36\n]\nit is in large part because the field has given birth to some of the most active domains of today's biological sciences, such as\nneuroscience\n,\nendocrinology\n, and\nimmunology\n.\n[\n37\n]\nFurthermore, physiology is still often seen as an integrative discipline, which can put together into a coherent framework data coming from various different domains.\n[\n35\n]\n[\n38\n]\n[\n39\n]\nNotable physiologists\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nList of physiologists\nWomen in physiology\n[\nedit\n]\nInitially, women were largely excluded from official involvement in any physiological society. The\nAmerican Physiological Society\n, for example, was founded in 1887 and included only men in its ranks.\n[\n40\n]\nIn 1902, the American Physiological Society elected\nIda Hyde\nas the first female member of the society.\n[\n41\n]\nHyde, a representative of the\nAmerican Association of University Women\n, a global non-profit organization that advances equity for women and girls in education,\n[\n42\n]\nattempted to promote gender equality in every aspect of science and medicine.\nSoon thereafter, in 1913,\nJ.S. Haldane\nproposed that women be allowed to formally join\nThe Physiological Society\n, which had been founded in 1876.\n[\n43\n]\nOn 3 July 1915, six women were officially admitted:\nFlorence Buchanan\n,\nWinifred Cullis\n,\nRuth Skelton\n,\nSarah C. M. Sowton\n,\nConstance Leetham Terry\n, and\nEnid M. Tribe\n.\n[\n44\n]\nThe centenary of the election of women was celebrated in 2015 with the publication of the book \"Women Physiologists: Centenary Celebrations And Beyond For The Physiological Society.\" (\nISBN\n978-0-9933410-0-7\n)\nProminent women physiologists include:\nBodil Schmidt-Nielsen\n, the first woman president of the\nAmerican Physiological Society\nin 1975.\n[\n45\n]\nGerty Cori\n,\n[\n46\n]\nalong with her husband\nCarl Cori\n, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947 for their discovery of the\nphosphate\n-containing form of\nglucose\nknown as\nglycogen\n, as well as its function within\neukaryotic\nmetabolic\nmechanisms for energy production. Moreover, they discovered the\nCori cycle\n, also known as the Lactic acid cycle,\n[\n47\n]\nwhich describes how muscle tissue converts glycogen into lactic acid via\nlactic acid fermentation\n.\nBarbara McClintock\nwas rewarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of\ngenetic transposition\n. McClintock is the only female recipient who has won an unshared Nobel Prize.\n[\n48\n]\nGertrude Elion\n,\n[\n49\n]\nalong with\nGeorge Hitchings\nand\nSir James Black\n, received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1988 for their development of drugs employed in the treatment of several major diseases, such as\nleukemia\n, some\nautoimmune disorders\n,\ngout\n,\nmalaria\n, and\nviral herpes\n.\nLinda B. Buck\n,\n[\n50\n]\nalong with\nRichard Axel\n, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2004 for their discovery of\nodorant receptors\nand the complex organization of the\nolfactory system\n.\nFrançoise Barré-Sinoussi\n,\n[\n51\n]\nalong with\nLuc Montagnier\n, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2008 for their work on the identification of the\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus\n(HIV), the cause of\nAcquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome\n(AIDS).\nElizabeth Blackburn\n,\n[\n52\n]\nalong with\nCarol W.

A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed, burned, mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable, as might happen in a plane crash. Forensic anthropologists are also instrumental in the investigation and documentation of\ngenocide\nand\nmass graves\n. Along with\nforensic pathologists\n,\nforensic dentists\n, and homicide investigators, forensic anthropologists commonly testify in court as\nexpert witnesses\n. Using physical markers present on a skeleton, a forensic anthropologist can potentially determine a person's age,\nsex\n,\nstature\n, and\nrace\n. In addition to identifying physical characteristics of the individual, forensic anthropologists can use skeletal abnormalities to potentially determine\ncause of death\n,\npast trauma\nsuch as broken bones or medical procedures, as well as diseases such as\nbone cancer\n.\nThe methods used to identify a person from a skeleton relies on the past contributions of various anthropologists and the study of human skeletal\ndifferences\n. Through the collection of thousands of specimens and the analysis of differences within a population, estimations can be made based on physical characteristics. Through these, a set of remains can potentially be identified. The field of forensic anthropology grew during the twentieth century into a fully recognized forensic specialty involving trained anthropologists as well as numerous research institutions gathering data on decomposition and the effects it can have on the skeleton.\nModern uses\n[\nedit\n]\n[[Image: Srebrenica Massacre - Exhumed Grave of Victims - Potocari 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Exhumed bodies of victims of the 1995 Srebrenica Genocide in a mass grave found in 2007.\nToday, forensic anthropology is a well-established discipline within the forensic field. Anthropologists are called upon to investigate remains and to help identify individuals from bones when other physical characteristics that could be used to identify a body no longer exist. Forensic anthropologists work in conjunction with forensic pathologists to identify remains based on their skeletal characteristics. If the victim is not found for a lengthy period or has been eaten by\nscavengers\n, flesh markers used for identification would be destroyed, making normal identification difficult if not impossible. Forensic anthropologists can provide physical characteristics of the person to input into missing person databases such as that of the\nNational Crime Information Center\nin the US\n[\n2\n]\nor\nINTERPOL\n's\nyellow notice\ndatabase.\n[\n3\n]\nIn addition to these duties, forensic anthropologists often assist in the investigation of war crimes and mass fatality investigations. Anthropologists have been tasked with helping to identify victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks,\n[\n4\n]\nas well as plane crashes such as the\nArrow Air Flight 1285\ndisaster\n[\n5\n]\nand the\nUSAir Flight 427\ndisaster where the flesh had been vaporized or so badly mangled that normal identification was impossible.\n[\n6\n]\nAnthropologists have also helped identify victims of genocide in countries around the world, often long after the actual event. War crimes anthropologists have helped investigate include the\nRwandan genocide\n[\n7\n]\nand the\nSrebrenica Genocide\n.\n[\n8\n]\nOrganizations such as the Forensic Anthropology Society of Europe, the British Association for Forensic Anthropology, and the American Society of Forensic Anthropologists continue to provide guidelines for the improvement of forensic anthropology and the development of standards within the discipline.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nEarly history\n[\nedit\n]\nEarnest Hooton, one of the pioneers in the field of physical anthropology.\nThe use of\nanthropology\nin the forensic investigation of remains grew out of the recognition of anthropology as a distinct scientific discipline and the growth of\nphysical anthropology\n. The field of anthropology began in the United States and struggled to obtain recognition as a legitimate science during the early years of the twentieth century.\n[\n9\n]\nEarnest Hooton\npioneered the field of physical anthropology and became the first physical anthropologist to hold a full-time teaching position in the United States.\n[\n10\n]\nHe was an organizing committee member of the\nAmerican Association of Physical Anthropologists\nalong with its founder\nAleš Hrdlička\n. Hooton's students created some of the first doctoral programs in physical anthropology during the early 20th century.\n[\n11\n]\nIn addition to physical anthropology, Hooton was a proponent of\ncriminal anthropology\n.\n[\n12\n]\nNow considered a\npseudoscience\n, criminal anthropologists believed that\nphrenology\nand\nphysiognomy\ncould link a person's behavior to specific physical characteristics. The use of criminal anthropology to try to explain certain criminal behaviors arose out of the\neugenics\nmovement, popular at the time.\n[\n13\n]\nIt is because of these ideas that skeletal differences were measured in earnest eventually leading to the development of\nanthropometry\nand the Bertillon method of skeletal measurement by\nAlphonse Bertillon\n. The study of this information helped shape anthropologists' understanding of the human skeleton and the multiple skeletal differences that can occur.\nAnother prominent early anthropologist,\nThomas Wingate Todd\n, was primarily responsible for the creation of the first large collection of human skeletons in 1912. In total, Todd acquired 3,300 human skulls and skeletons, 600\nanthropoid\nskulls and skeletons, and 3,000 mammalian skulls and skeletons.\n[\n13\n]\nTodd's contributions to the field of anthropology remain in use in the modern era and include various studies regarding\nsuture\nclosures on the skull and timing of teeth eruption in the\nmandible\n. Todd also developed age estimates based on physical characteristics of the\npubic symphysis\n. Though the standards have been updated, these estimates are still used by forensic anthropologists to narrow down an age range of\nskeletonized\nremains.\n[\n14\n]\nThese early pioneers legitimized the field of anthropology, but it was not until the 1940s, with the help of Todd's student,\nWilton M. Krogman\n, that forensic anthropology gained recognition as a legitimate subdiscipline.\nThe growth of forensic anthropology\n[\nedit\n]\nDuring the 1940s, Krogman was the first anthropologist to actively publicize anthropologists' potential forensic value, going as far as placing advertisements in the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin informing agencies of the ability of anthropologists to assist in the identification of skeletal remains. This period saw the first official use of anthropologists by federal agencies including the FBI. During the 1950s, the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps employed forensic anthropologists in the identification of war casualties during the Korean War.\n[\n12\n]\nIt was at this time that forensic anthropology officially began. The sudden influx of available skeletons for anthropologists to study, whose identities were eventually confirmed, allowed for the creation of more accurate formulas for the identification of sex, age,\n[\n15\n]\nand stature\n[\n16\n]\nbased solely on skeletal characteristics. These formulas, developed in the 1940s and refined by war, are still in use by modern forensic anthropologists.\nThe\nprofessionalization\nof the field began soon after, during the 1950s and 1960s. This move coincided with the replacement of\ncoroners\nwith\nmedical examiners\nin many locations around the country.\n[\n12\n]\nIt was during this time that the field of forensic anthropology gained recognition as a separate field within the\nAmerican Academy of Forensic Sciences\nand the first forensic anthropology research facility and\nbody farm\nwas opened by\nWilliam M. Bass\n.\n[\n17\n]\nPublic attention and interest in forensic anthropology began to increase around this time as forensic anthropologists started working on more high-profile cases. One of the major cases of the era involved anthropologist Charles Merbs who helped identify the victims murdered by\nEd Gein\n.\n[\n18\n]\nMethods\n[\nedit\n]\nOne of the main tools forensic anthropologists use in the identification of remains is their knowledge of\nosteology\nand the differences that occur within the human skeleton. During an investigation, anthropologists are often tasked with helping to determinate an individual's sex, stature, age, and ancestry. To do this, anthropologists must be aware of how the human skeleton can differ between individuals.\nDetermination of sex\n[\nedit\n]\nDepending on which bones are present, sex can be determined by looking for distinctive\nsexual dimorphisms\n. When available, the\npelvis\nis extremely useful in the determination of sex and when properly examined can achieve sex determination with a great level of accuracy.\n[\n19\n]\nThe examination of the\npubic arch\nand the location of the\nsacrum\ncan help determine sex.\nFemale pelvis. Note wide pubic arch and shorter, pushed back sacrum\nMale pelvis. Note narrow pubic arch and longer sacrum.\nHowever, the pelvis is not always present, so forensic anthropologists must be aware of other areas on the skeleton that have distinct characteristics between sexes. The skull also contains multiple markers that can be used to determine sex. Specific markers on the skull include the\ntemporal line\n, the\neye sockets\n, the\nsupraorbital ridge\n,\n[\n20\n]\nas well as the\nnuchal lines\n, and the\nmastoid process\n.\n[\n21\n]\nIn general, male skulls tend to be larger and thicker than female skulls, and to have more pronounced ridges.\n[\n22\n]\nForensic anthropologists need to take into account all available markers in the determination of sex due to the differences that can occur between individuals of the same sex. For example, a female may have a slightly more narrow than a normal pubic arch. It is for this reason that anthropologists usually classify sex as one of five possibilities: male, maybe male, indeterminate, maybe female, or female.\n[\n23\n]\nIn addition, forensic anthropologists are generally unable to make a sex determination unless the individual was an adult at the time of death. The sexual dimorphisms present in the skeleton begin to occur during puberty and are not fully pronounced until after sexual maturation.\n[\n24\n]\nConsequently, there is currently no reliable method of sex determination of juvenile remains from cranial or post-cranial skeletal elements since dimorphic traits only become apparent after puberty, and this represents a fundamental problem in archaeological and forensic investigations. However, teeth may assist in estimating sex since both sets of teeth are formed well before puberty. Sexual dimorphism has been observed in both deciduous and permanent dentition, although it is much less in deciduous teeth.\n[\n25\n]\n[\n26\n]\n[\n27\n]\nOn average, male teeth are slightly larger than female teeth, with the greatest difference observed in the canine teeth.\n[\n28\n]\n[\n29\n]\n[\n30\n]\nExamination of internal dental tissues has also shown that male teeth consist of absolutely and proportionately greater quantities of dentine than females. Such differences in dental tissue proportions could also be useful in sex determination.\n[\n31\n]\n[\n32\n]\nDetermination of stature\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nestimation of stature\nby anthropologists is based on a series of formulas that have been developed over time by the examination of multiple different skeletons from a multitude of different regions and backgrounds. Stature is given as a range of possible values, in centimeters, and typically computed by measuring the bones of the leg, since they are the ones that best correlate with the total height of an individual.\n[\n33\n]\nThe three bones that are used are the\nfemur\n, the\ntibia\n, and the\nfibula\n.\n[\n34\n]\nIn addition to the leg bones, the bones of the arm,\nhumerus\n,\nulna\n, and\nradius\ncan be used.\n[\n35\n]\n[\n36\n]\nThe formulas that are used to determine stature rely on various information regarding the individual. Sex, ancestry, and age should be determined before attempting to ascertain height, if possible. This is due to the differences that occur between populations, sexes, and age groups.\n[\n37\n]\nBy knowing all the variables associated with height, a more accurate estimate can be made. For example, a male formula for stature estimation using the femur is\n2.32 × femur length + 65.53 ± 3.94 cm\n. A female of the same ancestry would use the formula,\n2.47 × femur length + 54.10 ± 3.72 cm\n.\n[\n38\n]\nIt is also important to note an individual's approximate age when determining stature. This is due to the shrinkage of the skeleton that naturally occurs as a person ages. After age 30, a person loses approximately one centimeter of their height every decade.\n[\n34\n]\nDetermination of age\n[\nedit\n]\nThe determination of an individual's age by anthropologists depends on whether or not the individual was an adult or a child. The determination of the age of children, under the age of 21, is usually performed by examining the teeth.\n[\n39\n]\nWhen teeth are not available, children can be aged based on which\ngrowth plates\nare sealed. The tibia plate seals around age 16 or 17 in girls and around 18 or 19 in boys. The\nclavicle\nis the last bone to complete growth and the plate is sealed around age 25.\n[\n40\n]\nIn addition, if a complete skeleton is available anthropologists can count the number of bones. While adults have 206 bones, the bones of a child have not yet fused resulting in a much\nhigher number\n.\nThe aging of adult skeletons is not as straightforward as aging a child's skeleton as the skeleton changes little once adulthood is reached.\n[\n41\n]\nOne possible way to estimate the age of an adult skeleton is to look at\nbone osteons\nunder a microscope. New osteons are constantly formed by bone marrow even after the bones stop growing. Younger adults have fewer and larger osteons while older adults have smaller and more osteon fragments.\n[\n40\n]\nAnother potential method for determining the age of an adult skeleton is to look for arthritis indicators on the bones. Arthritis will cause noticeable rounding of the bones.\n[\n42\n]\nThe degree of rounding from arthritis coupled with the size and number of osteons can help an anthropologist narrow down a potential age range for the individual.\nAge estimation of living individuals\n[\nedit\n]\nAge estimation of living individuals is carried out by estimating the biological age when the chronological age of the individual is unknown or uncertain because of the lack of valid identity documents.\n[\n43\n]\nIt is used to confirm if an individual has reached a specific age threshold in cases of criminal liability, asylum seekers and unaccompanied children, human trafficking, adoption, and competitive sports.\n[\n44\n]\nGuidelines by the Study Group on Forensic Age Diagnostics (Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Forensische Altersdiagnostik, AGFAD), propose that a three-step procedure should be followed for the age estimation: the first step is a physical examination; the second step include the assessment of the hand/wrist development using plain radiographs; the third step is a dental assessment.\n[\n45\n]\nOne of the most used methodologies for the estimation of age from the development of the hand and wrist is the Greulich and Pyle Atlas,\n[\n46\n]\nwhilst to assess dental development the most common method used so far is the 8-teeth technique developed by Demirjian\net al.\n.\n[\n47\n]\nWhere the estimated age of the individual might be above 18 years of age, it is possible to use the development of the medial end of the\nclavicle\n.\n[\n48\n]\nTraditionally, those undertaking age estimation in the living, adopt imaging techniques such as plain radiographies and CT scans to carry out the age estimation, however, lately, due to ethical issues surrounding the use of ionising medical imaging modalities for non-medical purposes (e.g., forensic purposes),\n[\n49\n]\nmagnetic resonance imaging\n, a radiation free medical imaging modality, is being investigated to develop new methodologies to estimate the age of living individuals.\n[\n50\n]\nDetermination of ancestry\n[\nedit\n]\nThe estimation of individuals' ancestry is typically grouped into three groups. However, the use of these classifications is becoming much harder as the rate of interancestrial marriages increases.\n[\n51\n]\nThe\nmaxilla\ncan be used to help anthropologists estimate an individual's ancestry due to the three basic shapes: hyperbolic, parabolic, and rounded.\n[\n52\n]\nIn addition to the maxilla, the\nzygomatic arch\nand the nasal opening have been used to narrow down possible ancestry.\n[\n53\n]\nBy measuring distances between landmarks on the skull as well as the size and shape of specific bones, anthropologists can use a series of equations to estimate ancestry. A program called\nFORDISC\nhas been created that will calculate the most likely ancestry using complex mathematical formulas.\n[\n54\n]\nThis program is continually updated with new information from known individuals to maintain a database of current populations and their respective measurements. A 2009 study found that even in favourable circumstances, FORDISC 3.0 classifications have only a 1% confidence level.\n[\n55\n]\nResearch presented at the 2012 Annual Meeting of the\nAmerican Association of Physical Anthropologists\nconcluded that ForDisc ancestry determination was not always consistent, and that the program should be used with caution.\n[\n56\n]\nOther markers\n[\nedit\n]\nAnthropologists are also able to see other markers present on the bones. Past fractures will be evident by the presence of\nbone remodeling\nbut only for a certain amount of time. After around seven years, bone remodelling should make the presence of a fracture impossible to see. The examination of any fractures on the bones can potentially help determine the type of trauma they may have experienced. Cause of death is not determined by the forensic anthropologist, as they are not qualified to do so. However, they are able to determine the type of trauma experienced such as gun shot wound, blunt force, sharp force, or a mixture thereof. It is also possible to determine if a fracture occurred ante-mortem (before death), peri-mortem (at the time of death), or post-mortem (after death). Ante-mortem fractures will show signs of healing (depending on how long before death the fracture occurred) while peri- and post-mortem fractures will not. Peri-mortem fractures can incorporate quite a large range of time, as ante-mortem trauma that is unrelated directly to death may not have had time to begin the healing process. Peri-mortem fractures will usually appear clean with rounded margins and equal discolouration after death, while post-mortem breaks will appear brittle.\n[\n57\n]\nPost-mortem breaks will often be a different colour to the surrounding bone i.e. whiter as they have been exposed to taphonomic processes for a different amount of time. However, depending on how long there is between a post-mortem break and removal this may not be obvious i.e. through re-interment by a killer. Diseases such as bone cancer might be present in\nbone marrow\nsamples and can help narrow down the list of possible identifications.\nSubfields\n[\nedit\n]\nForensic archaeology\n[\nedit\n]\nThe term \"forensic archaeology\" is not defined uniformly around the world, and is therefore practiced in a variety of ways.\n[\n58\n]\nForensic archaeologists employ their knowledge of proper excavation techniques to ensure that remains are recovered in a controlled and forensically acceptable manner.\n[\n59\n]\nWhen remains are found partially or completely buried the proper excavation of the remains will ensure that any evidence present on the bones will remain intact. The difference between forensic archaeologists and forensic anthropologists is that where forensic anthropologists are trained specifically in human osteology and recovery of human remains, forensic archaeologists specialize more broadly in the processes of search and discovery.\n[\n60\n]\nIn addition to remains, archaeologists are trained to look for objects contained in and around the excavation area. These objects can include anything from wedding rings to potentially probative evidence such as cigarette butts or shoe prints.\n[\n61\n]\nTheir training extends further to observing context, association and significance of objects in a crime scene and drawing conclusions that may be useful for locating a victim or suspect.\n[\n62\n]\nA forensic archaeologist must also be able to utilize a degree of creativity and adaptability during times when crime scenes can not be excavated using traditional archaeological techniques. For example, one particular case study was conducted on the search and recovery of the remains of a missing girl who was found in a septic tank underground. This instance required unique methods unlike those of a typical archeological excavation in order to exhume and preserve the contents of the tank.\n[\n60\n]\nForensic archaeologists are involved within three main areas. Assisting with crime scene research, investigation, and recovery of evidence and/or skeletal remains is only one aspect.\nProcessing scenes of mass fatality or incidents of terrorism (i.e. homicide, mass graves and war crimes, and other violations of human rights) is a branch of work that forensic archaeologists are involved with as well.\n[\n60\n]\nForensic archaeologists can help determine potential\ngrave sites\nthat might have been overlooked. Differences in the soil can help forensic archaeologists locate these sites. During the burial of a body, a small mound of soil will form from the filling of the grave. The loose soil and increasing nutrients from the decomposing body encourages different kinds of plant growth than surrounding areas. Typically, grave sites will have looser, darker, more organic soil than areas around it.\n[\n63\n]\nThe search for additional grave sites can be useful during the investigation of genocide and mass graves to search for additional burial locations.\nOne other discipline to the career of a forensic archaeologist is teaching and research. Educating law enforcement, crime scene technicians and investigators, as well as undergraduate and graduate students is a critical part of a forensic archaeologist's career in order to spread knowledge of proper excavation techniques to other forensic personnel and to increase awareness of the field in general. Crime scene evidence in the past has been compromised due to improper excavation and recovery by untrained personnel. Forensic anthropologists are then unable to provide meaningful analyses on retrieved skeletal remains due to damage or contamination.\n[\n64\n]\nResearch conducted to improve archaeological field methods, particularly to advance nondestructive methods of search and recovery are also important for the advancement and recognition of the field.\nThere is an ethical component that must be considered. The capability to uncover information about victims of war crimes or homicide may present a conflict in cases that involve competing interests. Forensic archaeologists are often contracted to assist with the processing of mass graves by larger organisations that have motives related to exposure and prosecution rather than providing peace of mind to families and communities. These projects are at times opposed by smaller, human rights groups who wish to avoid overshadowing memories of the individuals with their violent manner(s) of death. In cases like these, forensic archaeologists must practice caution and recognize the implications behind their work and the information they uncover.\n[\n65\n]\nForensic taphonomy\n[\nedit\n]\nThe examination of remains can help build a peri- and post-mortem profile of the individual.\nThe examination of skeletal remains often takes into account environmental factors that affect decomposition. Forensic\ntaphonomy\nis the study of these\npostmortem changes\nto human remains caused by soil, water, and the interaction with plants, insects, and other animals.\n[\n66\n]\nIn order to study these effects,\nbody farms\nhave been set up by multiple universities. Students and faculty study various environmental effects on the decomposition of donated\ncadavers\n. At these locations, cadavers are placed in various situations and their rate of decomposition along with any other factors related to the decomposition process are studied. Potential research projects can include whether black plastic causes decomposition to occur faster than clear plastic or the effects freezing can have on a dumped body.\n[\n67\n]\nForensic taphonomy is divided into two separate sections, biotaphonomy and geotaphonomy. Biotaphonomy is the study of how the environment affects the decomposition of the body. Specifically it is the examination of biological remains in order to ascertain how decomposition or destruction occurred.\n[\n68\n]\nThis can include factors such as animal scavenging, climate, as well as the size and age of the individual at the time of death. Biotaphonomy must also take into account common mortuary services such as embalming and their effects on decomposition.\n[\n69\n]\nGeotaphonomy is the examination of how the decomposition of the body affects the environment. Geotaphonomy examinations can include how the soil was disturbed, pH alteration of the surrounding area, and either the acceleration or deceleration of plant growth around the body.\n[\n68\n]\nBy examining these characteristics, examiners can begin to piece together a timeline of the events during and after death. This can potentially help determine the time since death, whether or not trauma on the skeleton was a result of perimortem or postmortem activity, as well as if scattered remains were the result of scavengers or a deliberate attempt to conceal the remains by an assailant.\n[\n69\n]\nEducation\n[\nedit\n]\nForensic Anthropology Lab at the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C., US\nIndividuals looking to become forensic anthropologists first obtain a bachelor's degree in anthropology from an accredited university. During their studies they should focus on physical anthropology as well as osteology. In addition it is recommended that individuals take courses in a wide range of sciences such as biology, chemistry, anatomy, and genetics.\n[\n70\n]\nOnce undergraduate education is completed the individual should proceed to graduate level courses. Typically, forensic anthropologists obtain doctorates in physical anthropology and have completed coursework in osteology, forensics, and archaeology. It is also recommended that individuals looking to pursue a forensic anthropology profession get experience in dissection usually through a\ngross anatomy\nclass as well as useful internships with investigative agencies or practicing anthropologists.\n[\n1\n]\nOnce educational requirements are complete one can become certified by the forensic anthropology society in the region. This can include the IALM exam given by the Forensic Anthropology Society of Europe\n[\n71\n]\nor the certification exam given by the American Board of Forensic Anthropology.\n[\n72\n]\nTypically, most forensic anthropologists perform forensic casework on a part-time basis, however there are individuals who work in the field full-time usually with federal or international agencies. Forensic anthropologists are usually employed in academia either at a university or a research facility.\n[\n73\n]\nEthics\n[\nedit\n]\nLike other forensic fields, forensic anthropologists are held to a high level of ethical standards due to their work in the legal system. Individuals who purposefully misrepresent themselves or any piece of evidence can be sanctioned, fined, or imprisoned by the appropriate authorities depending on the severity of the violation. Individuals who fail to disclose any\nconflict of interests\nor who fail to report all of their findings, regardless of what they may be, can face disciplinary actions.\n[\n74\n]\nIt is important that forensic anthropologists remain impartial during the course of an investigation. Any perceived bias during an investigation could hamper efforts in court to bring the responsible parties to justice.\n[\n75\n]\nThere is a substantial risk of\nconfirmation bias\nfrom knowledge of context, especially with more ambiguous or complex cases.\n[\n76\n]\n[\n77\n]\nIn addition to the evidentiary guidelines forensic anthropologists should always keep in mind that the remains they are working with were once a person. If possible, local customs regarding dealing with the dead should be observed and all remains should be treated with respect and dignity.\nNotable forensic anthropologists\n[\nedit\n]\nName\nNotable for\nRef\nSue Black\nFounding member of the British Association for Human Identification.

By the end of the 7th century, forensic procedures were being used to determine the guilt of criminals.\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\nAn early pioneer in criminal identification through biology was\nAlphonse Bertillon\n, also known as the \"father of criminal identification\".\n[\n5\n]\nIn 1879, he introduced a scientific approach to personal identification by developing the science of\nanthropometry\n.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\nAnthropometry involves the use of a series of body measurements to distinguish human individuals.\nKarl Landsteiner\n, in 1901, introduced the categorization of human blood into groups: A, B, AB, and O.\n[\n9\n]\nFrom this discovery,\nblood typing\n, became a fundamental tool in forensic science.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\nAfter this, advancements were made which contributed to the ease of using and detecting blood found at crime scenes, expanding the use of blood analysis in forensic biology. Leone Lattes discovered a method to determine the blood group of dried bloodstains in 1915.\n[\n12\n]\n[\n13\n]\n[\n14\n]\n[\n15\n]\nSubsequently, Albrecht H.O., a German chemist, developed\nluminol\nin 1928, which is used to detect trace blood stains at\ncrime scenes\n.\n[\n16\n]\n[\n17\n]\nAlec Jeffreys\ndeveloped\nDNA fingerprinting\nin 1984, which examines variations in DNA that can identify individuals. This has become eminently useful not only in\nforensic science\n, but also in resolving paternity and immigration disputes.\n[\n18\n]\nIn 1983,\nKary B. Mullis\nexpanded the use of DNA profiling by developing\nPCR\n(polymerase chain reaction), which amplifies DNA segments in-vitro, even in trace amounts.\n[\n19\n]\nDNA samples found in crimes scenes are often found in minute amounts and degraded states, and sometimes mixed with various body fluids from multiple individuals. Using PCR, these DNA samples can be amplified for analysis when they otherwise would be useless. Beyond forensics, PCR has made an impact on a wide range of fields, including disease diagnosis and virus detection.\n[\n20\n]\nDNA analysis\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nForensic DNA analysis\nDNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid\n, is one of the most popular pieces of evidence to recover at a crime scene.\n[\n21\n]\nEvidence containing DNA is regarded as\nbiological evidence\n, and is recognized as the \"golden standard\" in forensic science.\n[\n22\n]\n[\n23\n]\n[\n24\n]\nDNA analysis\nhas numerous applications, such as paternity testing, identification of unknown human remains, breakthroughs in cold cases, as well as connecting suspects and/or victims to a piece (or pieces) of evidence, a scene, or another person (either a victim or suspect).\n[\n21\n]\n[\n25\n]\n[\n26\n]\n[\n27\n]\nNuclear DNA evidence can be recovered from\nblood\n,\nsemen\n,\nsaliva\n,\nepithelial cells\nand\nhair\n(provided the root is still intact).\n[\n21\n]\nFurthermore,\nMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)\ncan be recovered from the shaft of hair,\nbone\n, and the roots of\nteeth\n.\nTo be used, biological evidence must be initially visually recognized at the crime scene. To aid in this, alternative light sources, or an\nAdvanced Light Source\n(ALS), are used.\n[\n28\n]\n[\n29\n]\nOnce a potential source is identified, presumptive tests are conducted to establish if there is a specified biological presence (semen, saliva, blood, urine, etc.).\n[\n21\n]\nIf positive, samples are collected and submitted for analysis to a laboratory, where confirmatory tests and further tests are performed.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n21\n]\nFor most forensic DNA samples,\nSTR analysis\nof\nautosomal\nshort tandem repeats (STR)\nis performed in an attempt to individualize the sample to one person with a high degree of statistical confidence.\n[\n30\n]\n[\n31\n]\n[\n32\n]\n[\n33\n]\nHere, STR markers for autosomal STR are used in forensic\nDNA typing\nto track down the missing, verify family connections, and potentially connect suspects to crime sites.\n[\n34\n]\nTaqMan Probes\nSTR electropherogram of a three-person mixture\nLaboratory analysis of DNA evidence involves the sample DNA being\nextracted\n, quantified, amplified, and visualized. There are several methods of DNA extraction possible including\norganic (phenol-chloroform) extraction\n,\nChelex\nextraction,\n[\n35\n]\nand\ndifferential extraction\n.\nQuantitation is commonly conducted using a form of the\npolymerase chain reaction\n, known as\nreal-time PCR\n,\nquantitative PCR (qPCR)\n.\n[\n36\n]\n[\n37\n]\nqPCR is the preferred method of DNA quantitation for forensic cases because it is very precise, human-specific, qualitative, and quantitative.\n[\n38\n]\n[\n39\n]\nThis technique analyses changes in fluorescence signals of amplified DNA fragments between each PCR cycle without needing to pause the reaction or open the temperature-sensitive PCR tubes.\n[\n38\n]\nIn addition to the components necessary for a standard PCR reaction (i.e. template DNA, carefully designed forward and reverse\nprimers\n,\nDNA polymerase\n[usually\nTaq\n],\ndNTPs\n, and a buffer solution containing Mg2+), qPCR reactions involve fluorescent dye-labelled\nprobes\nthat complement and anneal to the DNA sequence of interest that lies between the two primers.\n[\n38\n]\nA \"reporter\" (R) dye is attached at the 5' end of the fluorescent probe, while a \"quencher\" (Q) dye is attached at the 3' end. Before the DNA strands are extended by the polymerase, the reporter and quencher are close enough in space that no fluorescence is detected by the\ninstrument\n(the quencher completely absorbs/masks the fluorescence of the reporter). As the polymerase begins to extend the strand, the 5' end of the probe is degraded by the polymerase due to its\nexonuclease\nactivity. The reporter dye is released from the 5' end. It is no longer quenched, thus enabling fluorescence detection.\n[\n36\n]\n[\n37\n]\nA graph is constructed for the sample DNA comparing the presence of fluorescence (y-axis) to cycle number (x-axis) of the qPCR process. This is then compared to a standard curve of the cycle fluorescence threshold (y-axis) versus the log of known DNA concentrations (x-axis).\n[\n40\n]\nBy comparing the sample data to the standard curve, one may extrapolate the DNA concentration in the sample, which is essential to move forward with PCR amplification and\ncapillary electrophoresis\nto obtain a\nDNA profile\n. DNA profiles are produced as an\nelectropherogram\n. The obtained profile can be compared to known samples in\nCODIS\nto identify a possible suspect.\n[\n2\n]\nBased on known frequencies of the\ngenotype\nfound in the DNA profile, the DNA analyst may place a statistical measure of confidence on DNA match.\n[\n41\n]\nMitochondrial DNA analysis\n[\nedit\n]\nMitochondrial DNA\n(mtDNA) is used\n[\n42\n]\ninstead of\nnuclear DNA\nwhen forensic samples have been degraded, are damaged, or are in very small quantities. In many cases, these may be older human remains, sometimes ancient, and the only options for DNA collection are the body's bone, teeth, or hair.\n[\n43\n]\nmtDNA can be extracted from degraded samples since its presence in cells is much higher than nuclear DNA. There can be more than 1,000 copies of mtDNA in a cell,\n[\n44\n]\nwhile there are only two copies of nuclear DNA.\n[\n43\n]\nNuclear DNA is inherited from both the mother and the father but mtDNA is passed down from only the mother to all of her offspring.\n[\n45\n]\n[\n43\n]\nDue to this type of inheritance, mtDNA is useful for identification purposes in forensic work but can also be used for mass disasters, missing persons cases, complex kinship, and genetic genealogy.\n[\n43\n]\nThe main advantage of using mtDNA is its high copy number.\n[\n46\n]\nHowever, there are a few disadvantages of using mtDNA as opposed to nuclear DNA. Since mtDNA is inherited maternally and passed to each offspring, all members of the maternal familial line will share a\nhaplotype\n.\n[\n47\n]\nA\nhaplotype\n\"is a group of alleles in an organism that are inherited together from a single parent\". Sharing this haplotype among family members can cause an issue in forensic samples because these samples are often mixtures that contain more than one DNA contributor.\n[\n43\n]\nThe convolution and interpretation of mtDNA mixtures is more difficult than that of nuclear DNA, and some laboratories choose not to attempt the process\n[\n48\n]\nSince mtDNA does not recombine, the genetic markers are not as diverse as autosomal STRs are in the case of nuclear DNA.\n[\n47\n]\nAnother issue is that of\nheteroplasmy\n— when an individual has more than one type of mtDNA in their cells.\n[\n43\n]\nThis can cause an issue in interpreting data from questioned forensic samples and known samples that contain mtDNA.\n[\n49\n]\nHaving adequate knowledge and understanding of heteroplasmy can help ensure successful interpretation.\n[\n49\n]\nThere are some ways to improve success of mtDNA analysis. Preventing contamination at all testing stages and using positive and negative controls is a priority.\n[\n43\n]\nIn addition, the use of\nmini-amplicons\ncan be beneficial. When a sample of mtDNA is severely degraded or has been obtained from an ancient source, the use of small\namplicons\ncan be used to improve the success of amplification during\nPCR\n.\n[\n43\n]\nIn these cases primers amplifying smaller regions of HV1 and HV2 in the control region of mtDNA are used.\n[\n50\n]\nThis process has been referred to as the 'ancient DNA' approach.\n[\n43\n]\nThe first use of mtDNA as evidence in court was in 1996 in\nState of Tennessee v. Paul Ware\n.\n[\n51\n]\n[\n52\n]\nThere was only circumstantial evidence otherwise against Ware so the admittance of mtDNA from hairs found in the victim's throat and at the scene were key to the case.\n[\n52\n]\nIn 2004, with the help of the\nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children\nand\nChoicePoint\n, mtDNA was used to solve a 22-year-old cold case where the nuclear DNA evidence was not originally strong enough.\n[\n53\n]\nAfter mtDNA analysis, Arbie Dean Williams was convicted of the murder of 15-year-old Linda Strait, which had occurred in 1982.\n[\n53\n]\n[\n54\n]\nIn 2012, mtDNA evidence allowed investigators to establish a link in a 36-year-old investigation into the\nmurders of four Michigan children\n.\n[\n55\n]\nHair fibers found on the bodies of two of the children were tested and the mtDNA found to be the same for each sample. For the investigators this was a big break because it meant that the murders were likely connected.\n[\n55\n]\nDisciplines\n[\nedit\n]\nForensic anthropology\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nForensic anthropology\nAnthropology\nis applied to forensics most regularly through the collection and analysis of human skeletal remains.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n56\n]\n[\n57\n]\nThe primary goals of anthropological involvement include identification and aiding in scene reconstruction by determining details regarding the circumstances of the victim's death. In cases where conventional techniques\n[\n58\n]\nare unable to determine the identity of the remains due to the lack of soft tissue, anthropologists are required to deduce certain characteristics based on the skeletal remains. Race, sex, age and possible ailments can often be determined through bone measurements and looking for clues throughout the skeletal structure. This becomes necessary when conventional methods that use soft tissue\n[\n58\n]\nfail to establish the identity of remains.\nForensic botany\n[\nedit\n]\nForensic botany is the application of plant science to legal investigations. It involves the study of plant material, such as\nleaves\n,\nseeds\n,\npollen\n, and other plant properties, to gather evidence that can aid in criminal or civil proceedings.\n[\n59\n]\n[\n60\n]\nThe identification of plant material is crucial in forensic botany, as it can provide a link between an individual and a crime scene, pinpoint the geographical location of missing bodies, or establish the\npost-mortem interval\n(PMI) of a human skeleton.\n[\n61\n]\n[\n62\n]\nForensic botany can also help investigators determine the cause of death in cases where plant toxins are involved. For example, the presence of certain plant species in the stomach contents of a deceased individual may indicate accidental or intentional poisoning.\nIn addition to identifying plant material, forensic botanists may also analyze soil samples for traces of plant material, which can provide valuable information about the environment in which a crime occurred. The analysis of plant material and soil samples can be performed through various techniques, including optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and DNA analysis.\nSubspecialties In Forensic Botany\n[\nedit\n]\nSubdisciplines within forensic botany include:\nForensic palynology\n(study of pollen and spores). Palynology can produce evidence of decomposition time, location of death or the time of year.\nBryology\n(study of bryophytes). Bryology is the easiest to find evidence since bryophyte (a species of plants) attaches to shoes and clothes easily.\n[\n63\n]\nBryophytes\nare useful since even if they are ripped apart or broken down, DNA can still be analyzed.\nDendrochronology\n(study of the growth of rings of trees stems and roots)\nLichenology\n(study of lichens)\nMycology\n(study of fungi)\nForensic ornithology\n[\nedit\n]\nForensic ornithology is the application of scientific techniques to the examination and identification of bird remains for legal purposes. This field of study can aid in investigations related to wildlife crimes, such as poaching, smuggling, and illegal trade of birds and their feathers.\nFeathers are one of the most important pieces of evidence used in forensic ornithology.\n[\n64\n]\nEach bird species has unique feather characteristics that can be observed at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. These characteristics include the size, shape, color, and pattern of the feather, as well as the arrangement and structure of the barbs and barbules. By examining these features, a forensic ornithologist can determine the species of bird to which a feather belongs.\nOther types of bird remains can also be identified through forensic ornithology. Bones, for example, can be analyzed to determine the species of bird, as well as the age and sex of the individual. Blood samples can also be used to identify bird species through DNA analysis.\n[\n64\n]\nForensic ornithology can be used in a variety of contexts, including criminal investigations, wildlife management, and conservation efforts. By providing accurate identification of bird remains, this field of study can help to bring perpetrators of wildlife crimes to justice and protect endangered bird species.\nForensic odontology\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nForensic dentistry\nForensic odontology\n, also known as\nforensic dentistry\n, is the application of dental science to legal matters. It is a specialized field that has been instrumental in helping law enforcement detect and solve cases in criminal and civil proceedings.\nThe use of forensic odontology became more popular in the 1960s with the establishment of the first instructional program in the United States at the\nArmed Forces Institute of Pathology\n. Since then, forensic odontology has become widely known by both dental and law enforcement professionals.\nForensic odontologists are\ndental professionals\nwho use their expertise to establish a person's identity, interpret injuries in the oral and perioral regions, analyze and compare bite marks, and assist forensic pathologists in determining the cause of death if there is a possible contributing dental condition.\n[\n65\n]\nDental evidence is a valuable tool in establishing human identity by comparing the dental features of a deceased person with antemortem dental records.\n[\n66\n]\nForensic odontologists can also assist in age estimation in living and deceased persons, which can be useful in cases where the identity of a person is unknown.\nForensic pathology\n[\nedit\n]\nForensic pathology\nis a specialized field within forensic science that focuses on the examination of individuals who have died suddenly, unexpectedly, or violently to determine the cause and manner of death.\n[\n67\n]\nA forensic autopsy is a postmortem examination of the body and analysis of bodily fluids to provide information on the cause of death, manner of death, and mechanism of injury.\n[\n68\n]\nA\nforensic pathologist\nis a medical doctor who has extensive knowledge and expertise in both trauma and disease. They are responsible for performing autopsies and applying their knowledge of the human body and possible internal and external injuries to determine the cause and manner of death.\n[\n2\n]\nThe information obtained from an autopsy can greatly assist investigative efforts and scene reconstruction. A forensic pathologist may also collect evidence from the body, such as trace evidence or biological fluids, that can be used in criminal investigations, and testify in court as expert witnesses regarding their findings.\nForensic toxicology\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nForensic toxicology\nForensic toxicology is an interdisciplinary field that applies principles and methods from\ntoxicology\n,\nanalytical chemistry\n,\npharmacology\n, and\nclinical chemistry\nto aid in medical or legal investigations of\ndeath\n,\npoisoning\n, and drug use. The primary objective of forensic toxicology is the accurate detection, identification, and interpretation of chemicals and their metabolites in biological samples for the purpose of providing objective evidence to support medical or legal decisions. The results of forensic toxicology analyses can be used to determine the cause and manner of death, assess the role of drugs or chemicals in impairment or toxicity, and provide evidence in criminal or civil proceedings. The field of forensic toxicology requires a thorough understanding of the\npharmacokinetics\nand\npharmacodynamics\nof drugs and chemicals, as well as the\nanalytical techniques\nused to detect and quantify them in biological matrices.\nForensic microbiology\n[\nedit\n]\nForensic microbiology has become an increasingly promising area of research with the recent advances in\nmassive parallel sequencing\n, also known as\nnext-generation sequencing\n. This technology has enabled the analysis of microorganisms for various applications in forensic science, including biocrime, bioterrorism and epidemiology.\nMicroorganisms can serve as valuable sources of evidence in criminal cases, including:\nClarifying causes of death\nDrowning\nToxicology\nHospital-acquired infections\nSudden infant death\nShaken baby syndrome\nAssisting in human identification through the analysis of\nSkin flora\nHair microbiome\nBody fluid microbiome\nGeolocation purposes by analyzing\nSoil microbiome\nMicrobiomes of bodies of water\nEstimation of the\npost-mortem interval\nvia\nThe thanatomicrobiome,\n[\n69\n]\n[\n70\n]\nthe community of microorganisms that colonize a body after death\nEpinecrotic\n[\n71\n]\n[\n72\n]\nmicrobial communities, the microorganisms that colonize the surface of a decomposing body\n[\n73\n]\nBy analyzing the stage of decay from bacterial decomposition\n[\n72\n]\nor the bacterial succession patterns, scientists can estimate the time elapsed since death.\nBioterrorism and epidemiology\n[\nedit\n]\nBioterrorism refers to the deliberate use of biological agents as weapons of warfare. These agents, which can be natural or genetically modified microorganisms, are intentionally disseminated to cause illness, death, or harm to humans, animals, or plants.\n[\n74\n]\nRegardless of their origin, these biological weapons, which can be viruses, bacteria, or fungi, are highly infectious and pose a significant threat.\nForensic microbiology plays a crucial role in the study of epidemiology. By examining microorganisms obtained from infected individuals, scientists can determine the source of infection, identify the type of infection present, and analyze the mutation pattern of the microorganism. Forensic microbiologists compare the microorganisms isolated from infected individuals to known sources of infectious pathogens to identify the cause of an outbreak.\n[\n75\n]\nIt is important to note that biological agents used as weapons are often found in the environment, making it challenging to determine whether an infection is accidental or the result of a deliberate attack.\n[\n73\n]\nOne of the most notable cases of bioterrorism in recent history involved the mailing of at least four anthrax-containing envelopes in the United States in September and October 2001. This incident resulted in 11 people contracting inhalation anthrax, leading to five fatalities, while another 11 individuals were afflicted with cutaneous anthrax. Additionally, 31 persons tested positive for exposure to\nBacillus anthracis\nspores.\n[\n76\n]\nHowever, advancements in PCR and whole-genome sequencing enabled scientists to collaborate with the FBI to identify the source of the letter spores. The combination of forensic microbiology and modern technology is essential in identifying and preventing bioterrorism attacks.\nDifferentiating a biowarfare attack from a normal epidemiology outbreak\n[\nedit\n]\nWhen investigating a possible bioterrorist or biowarfare attack, the epidemiologic approach is unique from a typical epidemiologic investigation. The process begins by confirming that there has been an outbreak using laboratory and clinical evidence. Once the number of cases and definition of the attack has been established, the outbreak can be characterized by analyzing the time, place, and person affected. This information is critical in identifying the source of the outbreak. By gathering data on cases over time, an epidemic curve can be created. The pattern of the disease is important in distinguishing between a natural outbreak and an intentional attack. In the case of a bioterrorism attack, the source is most likely a single point, with everyone coming into contact with the agent at the same time. Other factors that are investigated to determine if the outbreak is the result of a biological attack include a large epidemic, more severe disease than expected for a given pathogen, an uncommon disease for a specific area, and multiple simultaneous epidemics of different diseases.\n[\n77\n]\nPost-mortem microbial analysis\n[\nedit\n]\nOne of the earliest studies on post-mortem microbial analysis was published by\nÉmile Achard\n.\n[\n78\n]\nPost-mortem microbiology is a field that aims to detect unexpected infections causing sudden deaths, confirm clinically suspected but unproven infections, evaluate the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy, identify emergent pathogens, and recognize medical errors. Additionally, the analysis of the thanatomicrobiome may help estimate the post-mortem interval.\n[\n79\n]\nCurrently, extensive research is being conducted to determine if there is a consistent microbial decomposition \"clock\" that could be used by itself or in conjunction with other techniques, such as forensic entomology, to help estimate postmortem intervals.\nOne research group has made significant progress in describing such a microbial clock and believes they are within two to five years of testing it in a real crime scene scenario.\n[\n80\n]\nHowever, if a reliable and consistent microbial clock is determined to exist, it remains to be seen whether it will pass scientific and legal muster. A judge would also have to determine that the microbial clock meets the standard for admission of expert testimony.\n[\n80\n]\nForensic limnology\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nForensic limnology\nForensic limnology is the application of limnology, the study of inland waters, to forensic science. In cases involving a body of water at or near the scene of a crime, a sample of the water can be extracted and analyzed to identify the presence and composition of microorganisms, which can act as a form of\ntrace evidence\n. One such microorganism are diatoms, a type of microalgae that vary in shape and are unique to specific bodies of water. By analyzing the diatom composition in a sample of water, investigators can establish if a person or questioned piece of evidence has been in contact with a specific body of water. This is because\ndiatoms\nare specific to certain bodies of water, and if a sample contains diatoms found only in a specific body of water, it can be used as evidence to link a person or object to that location. Forensic limnology can be used in conjunction with other forensic techniques to provide a more comprehensive analysis of a crime scene.\n[\n81\n]\nForensic entomology\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nForensic entomology\nCurrent issues\n[\nedit\n]\nThe examples and perspective in this section\ndeal primarily with the United States and do not represent a\nworldwide view\nof the subject\n.\nYou may\nimprove this section\n, discuss the issue on the\ntalk page\n, or create a new section, as appropriate.\n(\nAugust 2021\n)\n(\nLearn how and when to remove this message\n)\nSexual assault kit backlog\n[\nedit\n]\nAs DNA is a critical form of evidence in the investigation of cases of sexual violence, the backlog of untested sexual assault kits (SAKs), also known as a\nrape kit\n, greatly affects the successful identification and prosecution of the perpetrators of these crimes. According to\nRAINN\n(Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network), the largest anti-sexual violence organization in the United States, the backlog is the result of both a failure of law enforcement to send collected kits to forensic laboratories for analysis, and a lack of resources within these labs to process the kits effectively.\n[\n82\n]\nIn the absence of adequate funding, many districts would rather dedicate their funds to homicides or more high-profile cases, and cases of sexual violence are often swept to the side. With this, as the SAKs remain in storage, the prevalence of the issue increases, especially as more and more kits are being found each year.\n[\n83\n]\nCold cases\n[\nedit\n]\nWith the considerable advances in DNA analysis, old, open cases with intact evidence can be examined for biological evidence.\n[\n30\n]\nNew profiles are uploaded to\nCODIS\nevery day so the base population to search and compare to increases. Biological testing for cold cases, specifically homicides, encounters similar roadblocks as the SAKs - lack of funds or the DNA samples have not been properly stored; thus too much degradation has occurred for viable analyses.\nPopular culture\n[\nedit\n]\nIn popular culture, forensic biology is frequently portrayed in shows like\nLaw & Order\n,\nHannibal,\nBones\n,\nCSI\n,\nDexter\nand\nCastle\n. However thanks to Hollywood's depiction of forensic science, the analysis of biological evidence has fallen prey to the\nCSI Effect\n, which results in the public's perception of its capabilities being severely distorted and its limits blurred.\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nDNA profiling\nForensic chemistry\nForensic science\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\n\"Forensic Biology | Forensic Science\"\n.\nforensic.unl.edu\n.

This is done with the purpose of drawing inferences about the nature, timing and other details of the crime.\n[\n1\n]\nAt its core, BPA revolves around recognizing and categorizing bloodstain patterns, a task essential for reconstructing events in crimes or accidents, verifying statements made during investigations, resolving uncertainties about involvement in a crime, identifying areas with a high likelihood of offender movement for prioritized DNA sampling, and discerning between homicides, suicides, and accidents.\n[\n2\n]\nSince the late 1950s, BPA experts have claimed to be able to use biology, physics, and mathematical calculations to reconstruct with accuracy events at a crime scene, and these claims have been accepted by the criminal justice system in the US.\n[\n3\n]\nBloodstain pattern analysts use a variety of different classification methods. The most common classification method was created by S. James, P. Kish, and P. Sutton,\n[\n4\n]\nand it divides bloodstains into three categories: passive, spatter, and altered.\nDespite its importance, classifying bloodstain patterns poses challenges due to the absence of a universally accepted methodology and the natural uncertainty in interpreting such patterns. Current classification methods often describe pattern types based on their formation mechanisms rather than observable characteristics, complicating the analysis process.\n[\n5\n]\nIdeally, BPA involves meticulous evaluation of pattern characteristics against objective criteria, followed by interpretation to aid crime scene reconstruction.\n[\n5\n]\nHowever, the lack of discipline standards in methodology underscores the need for consistency and rigor in BPA practices.\nThe validity of bloodstain pattern analysis has been questioned since the 1990s, and more recent studies cast significant doubt on its accuracy.\n[\n6\n]\nA comprehensive 2009\nNational Academy of Sciences\nreport concluded that \"the uncertainties associated with bloodstain pattern analysis are enormous\" and that purported bloodstain pattern experts' opinions are \"more subjective than scientific\".\n[\n7\n]\n[\n6\n]\nThe report highlighted several incidents of blood spatter analysts overstating their qualifications and questioned the reliability of their methods.\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\nIn 2021, the largest-to-date study on the accuracy of BPA was published, with results \"show[ing] that [BPA conclusions] were often erroneous and often contradicted other analysts.\"\n[\n9\n]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nEarly history\n[\nedit\n]\nBloodstain pattern analysis has been used informally for centuries, but the first modern study of blood stains was in 1895. Dr. Eduard Piotrowski of the University of Kraków published a paper titled \"On the formation, form, direction, and spreading of blood stains after blunt trauma to the head.\"\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\nHe conducted his first experiments on rabbits.\n[\n12\n]\nA number of publications describing various aspects of blood stains were published, but his publication did not lead to a systematic analysis. LeMoyne Snyder's widely used book\nHomicide Investigation\n(first published in 1941 and updated occasionally through at least the 1970s) also briefly mentioned details that later bloodstain experts would expand upon (e.g., that blood dries at a relatively predictable rate; that arterial blood is a brighter red color than other blood; that bloodstains tend to fall in certain patterns based on the motion of an attacker and victim).\n[\n13\n]\nA 1952 episode of the\npolice procedural\nradio series\nDragnet\nmade reference to bloodstain pattern analysis to reconstruct a shooting incident.\n[\n14\n]\nAcceptance as valid evidence in United States courts\n[\nedit\n]\nBetween 1880 and 1957, courts in\nMichigan\n,\nMississippi\n,\nOhio\n, and\nCalifornia\nrejected expert testimony for bloodspatter analysis, generally holding that it added nothing to the jurors' own evaluations of bloodstains submitted as evidence.\n[\n15\n]\nIn 1957, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court\nbecame the first American court to accept expert testimony examining bloodstains, accepting as evidence the testimony of\nPaul L. Kirk\n, a professor of\nbiochemistry\nand\ncriminalistics\n.\n[\n15\n]\nHe would also testify in the\nSam Sheppard\ncase in 1966, when the wife of an osteopathic physician was beaten to death in her home, interpreting bloodspatter evidence as proof that the murderer was left-handed (Sheppard was right-handed).\n[\n15\n]\nHowever, bloodstain pattern analysis would not begin to enter wide use until it was promoted by Herbert Leon MacDonell. MacDonell researched bloodstains with a grant from the\nUnited States Department of Justice\n, and which also published his research in the book \"Flight Characteristics and Stain Patterns of Human Blood\" (1971).\n[\n15\n]\nThe basis for MacDonell's alleged expertise was a set of experiments he conducted by extracting his own blood and then slinging it around in the basement of his house in\nCorning, New York\n.\n[\n16\n]\n[\n17\n]\nMacDonell testified in court on multiple occasions as an expert of bloodstain analysis, and the legal precedent set by these cases led to its widespread use in American courts, although as early as 1980 some\njudges\nexpressed strong doubts about its reliability, and it was not always accepted as evidence, especially in states with no prior rulings that relied on such evidence.\n[\n15\n]\nThe first formal bloodstain training course was given by MacDonell in 1973 in Jackson, Mississippi. MacDonell taught workshops on how to conduct bloodstain analysis, and the newly trained bloodstain analysts, who often had received as little as 40 hours of instruction, in turn would give expert\ntestimony\nin court cases.\n[\n15\n]\nIn 1983, the\nInternational Association of Bloodstain Pattern Analysts\nwas founded by a group of blood stain analysts to help develop the emerging field of bloodstain pattern analysis.\n[\n18\n]\nFurther investigation into its admissibility as evidence\n[\nedit\n]\nStarting in 1995, court cases where bloodstain analysts disagreed with each other raised concerns of the discipline's prediction's\nadmissibility as evidence\nin court.\n[\n19\n]\n[\n20\n]\n[\n21\n]\nIn 2009, the\nNational Academy of Sciences\npublished an examination of forensic methods used in\nUnited States\ncourts which harshly criticized both bloodstain pattern analysis and the credentials of the majority of the analysts and experts in the field.\n[\n15\n]\n[\n20\n]\nJudges have largely ignored the report's findings and continue to accept bloodstain pattern analysis as expert evidence.\n[\n15\n]\nIn 2013\nDaniel Attinger\n, a fluid dynamics researcher at Columbia University, published a paper on bloodstain pattern analysis in\nForensic Science International\n, finding that many of the central hypotheses of bloodstain analysis remain untested, and that existing analysts often made incorrect assumptions or other errors in their analyses. The paper also proposed\nfluid dynamics\nas a theoretical framework for solving these problems, and Attinger has continued to publish several papers exploring these concepts (as have other scientists as well). However, these papers are largely theoretical, and have had little impact on the use of bloodstain analysis in courts.\n[\n15\n]\nThe physics of blood\n[\nedit\n]\nPrinciples\n[\nedit\n]\nBlood is composed of three components suspended in plasma: erythrocytes (red blood cells), leukocytes (white blood cells), and thrombocytes (platelets).\n[\n22\n]\nWhen a blood vessel is damaged, the blood starts moving outside the circulatory system, following the laws of physics. If this leaking blood ever reaches the surface of the skin, it will be externalized and will likely come into contact with the person's surroundings. Some of the most common interactions are:\n[\n23\n]\nGravity\nAn internal source applying pressure on the blood (expiration, blood pressure, etc.)\nExternal force applied at the source of the bleeding (e.g., being hit with a weapon)\nTransfer or alteration resulting from two surfaces coming into contact (swipe, wipe, etc.)\nSince blood is 55% plasma (and 45% solid components suspended in plasma), it is an aqueous liquid and behaves as such. More specifically, it is a\nshear-thinning\n,\nnon-Newtonian fluid\n. Here are its three main physical properties:\n[\n23\n]\nViscosity\n(denoted by\nμ)\ndescribes the relation between force applied on the fluid and the rate at which the fluid particles can be separated from each other, or deformed.\n[\n23\n]\nIf a fluid has a high viscosity, it will not flow as easily as a fluid with a lower viscosity. Because this relates directly to the strength of the attraction between the fluid molecules, viscosity of blood decreases with increasing temperature and decreasing\nhematocrit\n. It also lowers with a higher shear, which is why it is classified as a shear-thinning, non-Newtonian fluid. This is why blood appears more watery when it hits a surface than right after it leaves the body.\n[\n23\n]\nThe closer the shear rate is to zero, the more viscous the blood is.\n[\n24\n]\nSome other factors can also influence blood viscosity.\n[\n23\n]\nSurface tension\n(denoted by\nσ\n)\ndescribes the energy required to change the shape of a fluid when it comes into contact with another fluid in which it is not\nmiscible\n(e.g., blood and air). This plays a big role in the formation of spherical blood droplets as they fall, as well as the way they react when they hit a surface.\n[\n23\n]\nSurface tension can also be affected by outside factors such as temperature and the presence of chemicals in the blood.\n[\n25\n]\nDensity\n(denoted by d) represents a fluid's mass per unit volume, which allows for comparison between substances. The reference for comparison is usually water since it has a density of 1 g/cm\n3\n.\n[\n26\n]\nBloodstain types\n[\nedit\n]\nShows how to determine area of convergence from blunt trauma blood spatter.\nDiagram showing how to calculate the area of origin of a blood spatter\nA bloodstain can present itself differently depending on the situation and the material on which it appears, and bloodstains may be hard to examine on porous surfaces such as fabric, and may be distorted.\n[\n27\n]\nBloodstain pattern analysts consider the angle of impact to determine its origin and the amount of force behind it;\n[\n28\n]\nvariations in external forces can cause satellite drops.\n[\n29\n]\nA point of origin can be determined by finding what bloodstain analysts call the \"area of convergence\" for the blood droplets.\n[\n30\n]\nTo find this point of origin, the shape of the blood and the length are often taken into account and the stringing method is implemented. In the stringing method, blood drop paths are depicted as straight lines. Strings are placed at the bloodstain positions and pulled away from the surface to reconstruct the direction of impact. This direction is determined by the shape and orientation of the bloodstains. The point where most strings intersect is considered the estimated location of the blood source.\n[\n31\n]\nThere is also a method known as the tangent method. In this method, the blood drops' paths are seen as right-angled triangle hypotenuses. This works best for fast-moving drops with flat trajectories, but uncertainties in their curvature may lead to errors in determining the blood source's horizontal position.\"\n[\n31\n]\nAdditionally, the angle of impact as well as other external factors such as the material on which the blood falls can change the shape and size of the blood.\n[\n29\n]\nThe point of impact can change the shape of the bloodstain. Bloodstains, instead of maintaining their original forms, may become elongated. In these cases, the blood may have a tail capable of indicating directionality.\n[\n32\n]\nIn order to find the angle of impact investigators measure the length and width of the blood droplet and use the formula\ns\ni\nn\n(\nA\n)\n=\nw\ni\nd\nt\nh\n/\nl\ne\nn\ng\nt\nh\n{\\displaystyle sin(A)=width/length}\n. The (A) representing angle of impact.\n[\n29\n]\nThree-dimensional modeling, animation, and laser scanning are increasingly used to reconstruct bloodstain arrangements within a crime scene. These digital methods allow analysts to see how the events possibly occurred by producing simulations based on laser scans of the scene, including the replication of bloodstain patterns and the positions and movements of individuals during bloodshed.\n[\n33\n]\n[\n34\n]\nIn some cases, these simulations have been used to clarify events and assisted in advancing criminal investigations.\n[\n35\n]\nPassive stains\n[\nedit\n]\nHow to calculate the point of origin of a blood spatter\nPassive or gravity bloodstains (bloodstain patterns that are formed under the influence of gravity)\n[\n4\n]\nare separated further into four categories: transfer/contact stains, flow artefacts, drop stains, and pooling.\n[\n2\n]\nTransfer stains occur when two surfaces come into contact and at least one is wet with blood, and it includes swipe and wipe patterns, which can give information regarding sequence of movement in some cases.\n[\n2\n]\nWipe patterns occur when a surface with blood is disturbed, where as a swipe pattern is when blood is deposited on a non-bloodied surface. Movement can be determined by feathering and a diminished volume of blood.\n[\n28\n]\nFlow artefacts arise from when a volume of blood is deposited on an angled or vertical surface. These flow patterns form when a volume of blood moves from one area to another. This can occur due to gravity or the contour and shape of a surface or victim.\n[\n28\n]\nDrop stains, when travelling through the air, keep shape due to surface tension until they reach their destination. The drop shape is indicative of the angle of impact as stated above.\n[\n29\n]\nPooling occurs when the source of the bleeding remains static for a certain period of time, the blood continuously dripping in the same location and resulting in an important accumulation. This may cause satellites, resulting in secondary mechanism spatter. This secondary mechanism spatter is produced when drops of blood land in pools of blood, splashing the area surrounding the pool.\n[\n28\n]\nIf the individual who is actively bleeding moves while blood is dripping, the resulting pattern will allow for determination of direction and relative speed of movement at that time.\nImpact spatter stains\n[\nedit\n]\nCast-off blood stain pattern\nImpact spatter is the most common bloodstain pattern type in a crime scene. It occurs when an object hits a source of blood.\n[\n36\n]\nIn impact blood spatter patterns, blood is often circular and not elongated.\n[\n37\n]\nThere are two types of impact spatter, back spatter and forward spatter.\n[\n36\n]\nBack spatter occurs when blood is projected back at an attacker, while forward spatter is blood that exits directly from the victim's wound and projects onto nearby surfaces.\n[\n36\n]\n[\n38\n]\nThe speed of the weapon used in the attack can cause changes in the size of blood spatter. The speed of the attack is classified into high, medium and low velocity attacks.\n[\n36\n]\nHigh-velocity spatter (e.g., gunshot wounds) create small-sized droplets. High-velocity spatter usually travels 100 feet per second and creates blood droplets sized 1 millimeter or less. Medium-velocity spatter (e.g.,\nblunt force trauma\n) is often made with a weapon and can create cast-off patterns. They are often made at between 5 and 25 feet/second the blood droplets ranging from 1 to 4 millimeters in length.\n[\n39\n]\nLow-velocity spatters are usually created just as a result of blood dripping from the individual (i.e., gravity).\n[\n29\n]\nCast-off patterns are associated with impact spatter. These patterns arise from blood being ejected from a bloodied or bleeding object during its movement, commonly observed in incidents involving physical assaults or strikes.\n[\n4\n]\nThey are commonly observed on ceilings when objects are swung overhead, although they can potentially appear on any surface within the surrounding area.\n[\n4\n]\nThese patterns may be used to guess the direction of a weapon swing. In these cases, the length and the shape of the bloodstain patterns can help determine the speed of the swing.\n[\n40\n]\nThese patterns create elongated or elliptical shapes in blood when it hits the surface of an object.\n[\n36\n]\nIn 1895, Dr. Eduard Piotrowski's experiment showed that these patterns are often created after the second hit using the weapon.\n[\n12\n]\nAltered stains\n[\nedit\n]\nAs defined in S. James, P. Kish, and P. Sutton,\n[\n28\n]\nany bloodstain can be subjected to physical or chemical changes that can alter the appearance of the stain. These can be changes like the aging, drying, clotting, the attempted removal or cleaning of a blood stain and the lack of a stain due to the interference of an object, known as void stain patterns.\n[\n28\n]\nAgeing and Drying occur will occur at the same time, with cracks in the blood droplets forming from the drying process and the darkening of the stain as it ages. The stain goes from a red to a dark red/brown as oxygen leaves the oxyhemoglobin in the red blood cells.\n[\n28\n]\nAs bloodstains dry the hematocrit evaporates, affecting the density of the blood droplet which has an effect on the surface tension.\n[\n41\n]\nClotting is caused by the fibrinogen platelets in the blood and a useful indicator of the passing of time at a scene.\n[\n28\n]\nIn a scenario where there are multiple stains, clotting will help establish a timeline of when bloodletting occurred at a scene. This includes postmortem wounds. It is important to note that stains with a smaller volume of blood may dry before the blood is given the opportunity to clot.\n[\n41\n]\nCleaning is often an attempt to hide or remove the stain itself with any number of detergents or bleach, but\nluminol\nis utilized to reveal the trace quantities of blood left over or missed.\n[\n28\n]\nIn some cases, void or shadow patterns can be observed. It is the result of a person or an object shielding an area from the blood coming toward it, and it is characterized by a clean area where blood stains are expected.\n[\n42\n]\nIt can help determine if whatever intercepted the blood has been moved since the incident occurred.\nResearch\n[\nedit\n]\nThe reliability of courtroom testimony by bloodstain pattern analysts has come under fire, particularly in the wake of a 2009 report by the\nNational Academy of Sciences\n,\n[\n15\n]\nwhich found the method of analysis to be \"subjective rather than scientific\", and that it involved an \"enormous\" degree of uncertainty.\n[\n43\n]\nIn addition to concerns over methodology, the report criticized the lack of proper certification requirements for analysts and an emphasis on \"experience over scientific foundations\".\n[\n43\n]\nMany bloodstain pattern analysts have testified in court as experts despite having received training only in the form of a 40-hour course taught independently by MacDonell or one of his students, without institutional accreditation or minimum educational requirements.\n[\n15\n]\nEven with proper training and methods, there are still many times where reputable analysts disagree on their findings, which calls into question the reliability of their conclusions and its value as evidence in court.\n[\n8\n]\nThere is very little empirical evidence to support the use of blood spatter analysis in court or any other aspect of the legal system.\n[\n15\n]\nWhile certain aspects of bloodstain pattern analysis, such as methods for determining the impact speeds of spattered blood, are supported by scientific studies, some analysts go well beyond what is verifiable.\n[\n43\n]\nIn addition to problems with the underlying scientific validity of the method, the circumstances of bloodstain pattern analyses, which are often conducted at the behest of either the prosecution or the defense in a court case, can introduce\nconfirmation bias\ninto the analyst's assessment.\n[\n43\n]\nIn 2016, the\nTexas Forensic Science Commission\nreviewed cases that had used bloodstain pattern analysis, and consequently established that starting in 2019, bloodstain pattern analysts will need accreditation to testify as experts in\nTexas\ncourts.\n[\n15\n]\nIn 2021, the largest study to date on the accuracy of bloodstain pattern analysis was published in\nForensic Science International.\nThe study was based on 33,005 multiple-choice responses and 1760 short text responses, by 75 practicing bloodstain pattern analysts on 192 bloodstain patterns selected to be representative of casework,\n[\n9\n]\nand stated:\nOur results show that conclusions were often erroneous and often contradicted other analysts. On samples with known causes, 11.2% of responses were erroneous. The results show limited reproducibility of conclusions: 7.8% of responses contradicted other analysts. The disagreements with respect to the meaning and usage of BPA terminology and classifications suggest a need for improved standards. Both semantic differences and contradictory interpretations contributed to errors and disagreements, which could have serious implications if they occurred in casework.\n[\n9\n]\nRelevant case histories\n[\nedit\n]\nA number of court cases are controversial due to their reliance on bloodstain pattern analysis:\nWarren Horinek\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 1996, Warren Horinek was convicted of murdering his wife in\nFort Worth, Texas\nbased largely on bloodstain evidence that has since been disputed.\n[\n19\n]\nThe police and the district attorney's office believed in Horinek's innocence. The appointed attorneys for the prosecution found a bloodstain pattern analyst who testified that, rather than being a suicide as believed for a number of reasons by police, it was a murder due to the pattern of small blood flecks found on the accused, which according to the analyst had to have come from \"high velocity\" blood from a gunshot, rather than blood that simply got on him through his attempts to provide medical aid to the victim. Other bloodstain pattern analysts have since disputed this claim and said that the bloodstains were consistent with medical aid. The original analyst has conceded that his claim is not as strong as he originally presented it as being, although he still believes in Horinek's guilt.\n[\n19\n]\nAs of 2025, Horinek remains in prison.\n[\n44\n]\n[\nself-published source\n]\nDavid Camm\n[\nedit\n]\nIn the criminal case against\nDavid Camm\n, who was tried three times in Indiana for the murder of his family largely on the basis of blood spatter evidence, both prosecution and the defense used expert bloodstain pattern analysts to interpret the source of the approximately 8 drops of blood on his shirt. The prosecution's experts included Tom Bevel and Rod Englert, who testified that the stains were high-velocity impact spatter. Five witnesses testified for the defense that the stains were transferred from his shirt brushing against his daughter's hair.\n[\n20\n]\nDr. Robert Shaler, Founding Director of the Penn State Forensic Science Program, decried blood spatter analysis as unreliable in the Camm case. \"The problem, in this case, is the number of stains [ ⁠is ⁠] minimal,\" he said. \"I think you're really on the edge of reliability.\" All of the blood spatter analysts involved in the case are \"\nexperts\"\nin the traditional sense. Quoting Shaler, \"We have two opinions in this case. That, in essence, is a 50 percent error rate. \" This would be ⁠an unacceptable level of reliability in a court case given that the perception of\nguilt\nbeyond a reasonable doubt\nis what is required.\n[\n45\n]\nFurther complicating matters was the testimony of Rob Stites, who testified for the prosecution as an expert blood spatter analyst. It was later uncovered that he had no training and his credentials were fabrications by the prosecutor. His testimony that the blood on Camm's shirt was high-velocity impact spatter aided in the conviction of David Camm. Dr. Shaler pointed out that one limitation of blood spatter analysis testimony is that \"you do not have the supporting underlying science\" to back up your conclusions. When Stites testified, the jury had no way of knowing that he was not the expert that he purported to be. Even among the expert witnesses, it is unknown which set of experts interpreted the stains accurately as there is no objective way of determining which bloodstain pattern analyst has applied the science correctly.\n[\n46\n]\nTravis Stay\n[\nedit\n]\nOther times, bloodstain patterns from different causes can mimic each other. In the 2008 North Dakota trial of Travis Stay for the murder of Joel Lovelien, prosecution witness Terry Laber testified that the blood spatter on Stay's clothing came from blows to Lovelien during a fist fight. After a review of the evidence by Paul Kish, another bloodstain pattern analyst, Laber reviewed the report submitted by Kish and revised his findings to include the possibility that the blood came from expiration by Lovelien.\n[\n21\n]\nIn popular culture\n[\nedit\n]\nSam Tyler\n, the time-travelling detective in episode 3 of the BBC TV series\nLife on Mars\n, asks his colleague\nChris Skelton\nto make a blood pattern analysis, quickly realizing by his puzzled expression that in 1973 such techniques are not known.\nSerial killer\nDexter Morgan\nof the\nDexter\nnovels and\nShowtime\nseries\nis a blood spatter analyst for the fictitious Miami Metro Police Department.\nCatherine Willows\nand\nJulie Finlay\nare blood spatter analysts on the CBS series\nCSI: Crime Scene Investigation\n.\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\nA Simplified Guide To Bloodstain Pattern Analysis\n,\nThe National Forensic Science Technology Center (NFSTC), Florida International University\n^\na\nb\nc\nBrodbeck, Silke (2012). \"Introduction to Bloodstain Pattern Analysis\".\nSIAK-Journal − Journal for Police Science and Practice\n:\n51–\n57.\ndoi\n:\n10.7396/IE_2012_E\n.\nISSN\n1813-3495\n.\n^\nJames, Stuart H.; Kish, Paul E.; Sutton, T.

Forensic dentistry is used in both criminal and civil law.\n[\n1\n]\nForensic dentists assist investigative agencies in identifying\nhuman remains\n, particularly in cases when identifying information is otherwise scarce or nonexistent—for instance, identifying burn victims by consulting the victim's dental records.\n[\n2\n]\nForensic dentists may also be asked to assist in determining the age,\nrace\n,\noccupation\n, previous dental history, and\nsocioeconomic status\nof unidentified human beings.\nForensic dentists may make their determinations by using\nradiographs\n, ante- and post-mortem\nphotographs\n, and\nDNA\nanalysis. Another type of evidence that may be analyzed is bite marks, whether left on the victim (by the attacker), the perpetrator (from the victim of an attack), or on an object found at the\ncrime scene\n. However, this latter application of forensic dentistry has proven highly controversial, as no scientific studies or evidence substantiate that bite marks can demonstrate sufficient detail for positive identification and numerous instances where experts diverge widely in their evaluations of the same bite mark evidence.\n[\n3\n]\nBite mark analysis has been condemned by several scientific bodies, such as the\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology\n(NIST),\n[\n4\n]\nNational Academy of Sciences\n(NAS),\n[\n3\n]\nthe\nPresident's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology\n(PCAST),\n[\n5\n]\nand the\nTexas Forensic Science Commission\n.\n[\n6\n]\nTraining\n[\nedit\n]\nIndia\n[\nedit\n]\nIn India, certificate courses offered include a modular course by\nD. Y. Patil Vidyapeeth, Pune\n, and some other private entities. The Indian Dental Association offers a fellowship program in FO which can be either a classroom program or an online program. Master's degree programs in different forensic disciplines along with M.Sc. Forensic Odontology is offered by National Forensic Sciences University which is the world's only university dedicated to forensic sciences.\nIt is a 2‑year full‑time course offered at the university's campus at Gandhinagar.\n[\n7\n]\nIndo-Pacific Academy of Forensic Odontology: The INPAFO Fellowship/Scholarship is a program offered by the Indo-Pacific Academy of Forensic Odontology (INPAFO) to support academic and professional development in forensic odontology. There are different types of fellowships, including the INPAFO Fellowship and the INPAFO Post Graduate Research Scholarship (IPGRS), which provide opportunities for research and skill enhancement. Additionally, INPAFO offers an Honorary Fellowship to recognize individuals with outstanding contributions and leadership in the field.\nmore about INPAFO Fellowships-scholarships\nAustralia\n[\nedit\n]\nPostgraduate diploma programs for dentists are available at\nThe University of Melbourne\n,\n[\n8\n]\nThe University of Western Australia\n,\n[\n9\n]\nand\nThe University of Adelaide\n.\n[\n10\n]\nBelgium\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Belgian university\nKU Leuven\noffers a master's in Forensic Odontology.\nUnited Kingdom\n[\nedit\n]\nFollowing the closure of the MSc course at the\nUniversity of Glamorgan\n, one can receive either an MSc in Forensic Dentistry (a one-year programme) or a Masters in Forensic Odontology (a two-year programme) from the\nUniversity of Dundee\nin Scotland, which currently has a very limited intake.\n[\n11\n]\nUnited States\n[\nedit\n]\nThere are two odontology training programs available in the US. One is a Fellowship program at The University of Texas Health Science at San Antonio Center Dental School,  and the other is a master's degree program through the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture College of Veterinary Medicine.\nCanada\n[\nedit\n]\nFor undergraduate studies, dental school candidates in Canada are required to complete a BA or at least three years of study in a BA program before completing a dental degree. BA Programs often involve science or biomedical but can include much more, as long as students have completed the basic prerequisites needed.\n[\n12\n]\nThere are no graduate study programs for forensic odontology specifically in Canada. Some universities have offered some involvement in forensic science disciples during clinical dental specialty projects, however, they will not graduate with credibility in the forensic odontology discipline.\nDental degrees given by universities in Canada include DDS (doctor of dental science) and DMD (doctor of dental medicine).\n[\n13\n]\nThere is no professional certification process for forensic odontologists in Canada currently. It is possible for Canadians to certify for the ABFO, a section of the American Academy of Forensic Science.\n[\n14\n]\nThis process also includes an examination as well as the candidates must complete a career checklist of accomplishments which will be reviewed. This checklist may include fellowships, working with recognized medicolegal death investigation agencies, completing a minimum level of casework and research, and providing testimony in court cases.\n[\n12\n]\nThe ABFO and the AAFS often hold scientific sessions which offer workshops including identification, civil litigation, age determination, and bite-mark analysis. These are beneficial in helping prospective forensic practitioners move towards board-eligible status.\n[\n12\n]\nIn Ontario, there is a group of 10 forensic dentists that are known as the Province of Ontario Dental Identification Team or better known as PODIT.\n[\n15\n]\nHigh-profile criminal cases\n[\nedit\n]\nForensic odontology has played a key role in famous criminal cases:\nIn 1692, during the\nSalem Witch Trials\n, Rev.\nGeorge Burroughs\nwas accused of\nwitchcraft\nand conspiring with the\nDevil\n, with biting his victims supposedly being evidence of his crimes. His bite marks and the bite marks of other people were compared to the victim's marks. The judges readily accepted the bite marks as evidence and this was the first time in what would become the United States that bite marks were used as evidence to solve a crime. He was later convicted and hanged. About two decades later, he was exonerated by the State, and his children were compensated for the wrongful execution.\n[\n16\n]\nOne of the first published accounts involving a conviction based on bite marks as evidence was the “Gorringe case”, in 1948, in which pathologist\nKeith Simpson\nused bite marks on the breast of the victim to seal a murder conviction against Robert Gorringe for the murder of his wife Phyllis.\n[\n17\n]\nAnother early case was\nDoyle v. State\n, which occurred in Texas in 1954. The bite mark, in this case, was on a piece of cheese found at the crime scene of a burglary. The defendant was later asked to bite another piece of cheese for comparison. A firearms examiner and a dentist evaluated the bite marks independently and both concluded that the marks were made by the same set of teeth. The conviction, in this case, set the stage for bite marks found on objects and skin to be used as evidence in future cases.\n[\n18\n]\nAnother landmark case was\nPeople v. Marx\n, which occurred in California in 1975.\n[\n19\n]\nA woman was murdered by strangulation after being sexually assaulted. She was bitten several times on her nose. Walter Marx was identified as a suspect and dental impressions were made of his teeth. Impressions and photographs were also taken of the woman's injured nose. These samples along with other models and casts were evaluated using a variety of techniques, including two-dimensional and three-dimensional comparisons, and acetate overlays. Three experts testified that the bite marks on the woman's nose were indeed made by Marx and he was convicted of voluntary manslaughter.\nFredrik Fasting Torgersen\nWayne Boden\n– an early case of Forensic Dentistry\nState of Florida\nv.\nTed Bundy\nState of New Jersey\nv.\nJesse Timmendequas\n(\nMegan's Law\ncase)\nPeople of\nCalifornia\nv. Marx, the 1975 case which established\nevidentiary\nstandards for forensic odontology\nPeople of\nArizona\nv.\nRay Krone\n, bite mark evidence led to a\nwrongful conviction\n.\nOrganizations\n[\nedit\n]\nForensic dentist examining specimens\nSeveral organizations are dedicated to the field of forensic odontology. These organizations include the Bureau of Legal Dentistry (BOLD), the American Board of Forensic Odontology (ABFO),\nAmerican Society of Forensic Odontology (ASFO)\n, the International Organization for Forensic Odonto-Stomatology (IOFOS) and the Association Forensic Odontology For Human Rights (AFOHR). Countries have their own forensic Odontological societies, including the British Association for Forensic Odontology (BAFO) and the Australian Society of Forensic Odontology (AuSFO). In 1996, BOLD was created at the\nUniversity of British Columbia\nto develop new technology and techniques in forensic odontology. The University of British Columbia program is the only one in North America that provides graduate training in forensic odontology.\n[\n20\n]\nIn Canada, The Royal College of Dentists has not recognized forensic odontology therefore there is no organization for Canada, however, there are three well-developed and trained groups for forensic dentistry. These groups include British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec.\n[\n12\n]\nBritish Columbia has a team called BC Forensic Odontology Response Team (BC_FORT) which is led by six dentists.\n[\n21\n]\nThey focus on disaster-victim identification work. Ontario has a team of ten forensic dentists called the Province of Ontario Dental Identification Team (PODIT).\n[\n12\n]\nQuebec has a team that is run out of McGill University and they offer a well-established forensic dentistry online course that focuses on human bite-mark evidence.\n[\n22\n]\nThese teams are kept small in order to maintain a relationship between forensic dentists and casework.\nThe Bureau of Legal Dentistry encourages the use of multiple dental impressions to create a “dental lineup”, similar to a suspect lineup used to identify alleged perpetrators of crime. Currently, dental impressions collected as evidence are compared only to those collected from a given suspect, which may bias the resulting outcome. Using multiple dental impressions in a lineup may enable forensic odontologists to significantly decrease the current bias in matching bite marks to the teeth of a suspect.\n[\n18\n]\nThe organization BOLD also supports the creation of a database of dental records, which could help in verifying dental uniqueness.\n[\n19\n]\nThis database could be created using criminal records or possibly all dental patients.\nIn 1984, the ABFO attempted to diminish the discrepancies and increase the validity of bite mark analysis by creating bite mark methodology guidelines. The guidelines attempt to establish standard terminology in describing bite marks and that reduces the risk of biased results. The ABFO also provides advice on how to effectively collect and preserve evidence. For example, they recommend that the collection of DNA evidence and detailed photographs of bites be taken together at the crime scene. The guidelines also outline how and what a forensic odontologist should record, such as the location, contours, shape, and size of a bite mark. They also provide a system of scoring to assess the degree to which a suspect's dental profile and bite mark match. According to the ABFO, the guidelines are not a mandate of methods to be used, but a list of generally accepted methods.\n[\n23\n]\nThe guidelines are intended to prevent potentially useful evidence from being thrown out simply because the forensic odontologist's collection methods were not standardized. Kouble and Craig used a simplified version of the ABFO scoring guidelines in order to retain accuracy with a larger sample of comparisons. A numerical score was assigned to represent the degree of similarity between the bite mark and model/overlay. The higher the score, the greater the similarity. In order to simplify the model, some features that were individually scored in the ABFO guidelines such as arch size and shape were assessed together while certain distinctive features such as spacing between teeth were treated as a separate variable. The authors believe that a simplified version would increase the strength of the comparison process.\n[\n24\n]\nIn an attempt to improve guidelines used to collect dental evidence, IOFOS developed one of the most recognized systems for the collection of forensic dental evidence\n[\n25\n]\n[\n26\n]\nIndo-Pacific Academy of Forensic Odontology:\nThe\nIndo-Pacific Academy of Forensic Odontology\n(INPAFO), established in 2007, is a leading professional body dedicated to advancing forensic odontology, with a strong presence in the Indo-Pacific region and global outreach. Under the guidance of its Patron, Dr.\nO. P. Jasuja\n, and visionary leadership of its Founder President, Dr.\nRakesh Gorea\n, the Academy has fostered collaboration, education, and research in this specialised field. With Dr.\nAman Chowdhry\nas General Secretary, INPAFO continues to expand its influence through initiatives such as the Journal of INPAFO, an acclaimed scientific publication. Learn more at\nwww.inpafo.in\nThere is only one international association promoting\nhumanitarian forensic odontology\n, called AFOHR. It was inaugurated in 2015 by a group of experts in Lyon during the Interpol DVI annual meeting, following the inspiration of Emilio Nuzzolese, forensic odontologist from Italy. In 2019 the group evolved into Association adopting a by Laws and an elected Board.\n[\n27\n]\nIn 2016, an association of civil protection called Dental Team DVI Italia was founded in\nBari, Italy\n, in order to offer pro bono services in the field of human identification and DVI Disaster Victim Identification to support Italian DVI teams.\n[\n28\n]\nBite mark analysis\n[\nedit\n]\nA bite mark is defined as a change in a surface's appearance due to the teeth coming into contact with it, leaving behind a dental pattern of the bite.\n[\n29\n]\nStudies have been performed in an attempt to find the simplest, most efficient, and most reliable way of analyzing bite marks and comparing them with one another and with suspects' teeth. There are two important notions when it comes to bite mark analysis: every individual has unique dentition that can be identifiable and this uniqueness can be found in a bite mark left in human skin.\n[\n30\n]\nThe theory behind bite mark analysis has been called into doubt in recent years, with many observers considering the entire field unscientific and invalid and calling for bite mark evidence to be inadmissible in court.\n[\n31\n]\n[\n32\n]\nProposed theoretical basis\n[\nedit\n]\nBites can occur on both the victim and the suspect;\nteeth\nare used as a weapon by the aggressor and in self-defense by the victim.\n[\n33\n]\nAlthough they are only a small portion of most forensic dentists' caseload, bite marks represent the most challenging aspect of the discipline. In addition to the location of the bite mark, the type of severity of the injury may give investigators clues as to the mental state of the offender. Bite marks may be found on the flesh of victims of a violent attack, particularly on the stomach or buttocks. Bite mark evidence may be the only form of physical evidence found on a body.\n[\n1\n]\nAlternatively, they may be found on the suspect, left by the victim during self-defense.  Bite marks can be altered through stretching, movement, or change in environment after the bite. Skin is not ideal for holding the shape of a bite mark as it can become distorted due to the viscoelasticity of the skin.\n[\n34\n]\nThere is also no set standard by which to analyze and compare bite marks.\nFactors that may affect the accuracy of bite mark identification include time-dependent changes of the bite mark on living bodies, effects of where the bite mark was found, damage on soft tissue, and similarities in dentition among individuals. Other factors include poor photography, impressions, or measurement of dentition characteristics.\n[\n35\n]\nMost bite mark analysis studies use porcine skin (pigskin), because it is comparable to the skin of a human, and it is considered unethical to bite a human for study in the United States. Limitations to the bite mark studies include differences in properties of pigskin compared to human skin and the technique of using simulated pressures to create bite marks.\n[\n36\n]\nAlthough similar histologically, pigskin and human skin behave in dynamically different ways due to differences in elasticity.\n[\n24\n]\nFurthermore, postmortem bites on nonhuman skin, such as those used in the experiments of Martin-de-las Heras et al., display different patterns to those seen in antemortem bite injuries. In recognition of the limitations of their study, Kouble and Craig\n[\n36\n]\nsuggest using a\nG-clamp\non an articulator in future studies to standardize the amount of pressure used to produce experimental bite marks instead of applying manual pressure to models on pigskin.\n[\n24\n]\nFuture research and technological developments may help reduce the occurrence of such limitations.\nKouble and Craig compared direct methods and indirect methods of bite mark analysis. In the past, the direct method compared a model of the suspect's teeth to a life-size photograph of the actual bite mark. In these experiments, direct comparisons were made between dental models and either photographs or \"fingerprint powder lift models.\" The \"fingerprint powder lift\" technique involves dusting the bitten skin with black fingerprint powder and using fingerprint tape to transfer the bite marks onto a sheet of\nacetate\n. Indirect methods involve the use of transparent overlays to record a suspect's biting edges. Transparent overlays are made by free-hand tracing the occlusal surfaces of a dental model onto an acetate sheet. When comparing the “fingerprint powder lift” technique against the photographs, the use of photographs resulted in higher scores determined by a modified version of the ABFO scoring guidelines. The use of transparent overlays is considered subjective and irreproducible because the tracing can be easily manipulated. On the other hand, photocopier-generated overlays where no tracing is used are considered to be the best method in matching the correct bite mark to the correct set of models without the use of computer imaging.\n[\n24\n]\nWhile the photocopier-generated technique is sensitive, reliable, and inexpensive, new methods involving digital overlays have proven to be more accurate.\n[\n35\n]\n[\n36\n]\nTwo recent technological developments include the 2D polyline method and the painting method. Both methods use Adobe Photoshop. The use of the 2D polyline method entails drawing straight lines between two fixed points in the arch and between incisal edges to indicate the tooth width. The use of the painting method entails coating the incisal edges of a dental model with red glossy paint and then photographing the model. Adobe Photoshop is then used to make measurements on the image. A total of 13 variables were used in the analysis. Identification for both methods was based on canine-to-canine distance (one variable), incisor width (four variables), and rotational angles of the incisors (eight variables). The 2D polyline method relies heavily on accurate measurements, while the painting method depends on the precise overlaying of the images. Although both methods were reliable, the 2D polyline method gave efficient and more objective results.\n[\n35\n]\nCriticism of bite mark analysis\n[\nedit\n]\nBite mark analysis has been criticized by the\nPresident's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology\n(PCAST). The PCAST has identified that bite mark analysis is an area which lacks clear standards in regards to the features needed to identify a particular set of dentition as having created a particular mark.\n[\n37\n]\nThe analysis of bite marks is subjective and is highly criticized.\n[\n37\n]\nSo called bite mark analysis has been criticized as largely unscientific based on three pillars of critique:\n[\n32\n]\n\"Human anterior dental patterns have not been shown to be unique at the individual level\"\n[\n32\n]\n\"Those patterns are not accurately transferred to human skin consistently\"\n[\n32\n]\n\"It has not been shown that defining characteristics of those patterns can be accurately analyzed to exclude or not exclude individuals as the source of a [\nsic\n] bitemark\"\n[\n32\n]\nRecently, the scientific foundation of forensic odontology, and especially bite mark comparison, has been called into question. A 1999 study by a member of the American Board of Forensic Odontology found a 63% rate of false identifications.\n[\n38\n]\nHowever, the study was based on an informal workshop during an ABFO meeting which many members did not consider a valid scientific setting.\n[\n39\n]\nIn February 2016, the Texas Forensic Science Commission recommended that bite mark evidence not be used in criminal prosecutions until it had a more firm scientific basis.\n[\n40\n]\nThat same year, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology declared that bite mark analysis had no scientific validity.\n[\n41\n]\nAn investigative series by the\nChicago Tribune\nentitled \"Forensics under the Microscope\" examined many forensic science disciplines to see if they truly deserve the air of infallibility that has come to surround them. The investigators concluded that bite mark comparison is always subjective and no standards for comparison have been accepted across the field. The journalists discovered that no rigorous experimentation has been conducted to determine error rates for bite mark comparison, a key part of the\nscientific method\n.\n[\n42\n]\nCritics of bite mark comparison cite the case of\nRay Krone\n, an Arizona man convicted of murder on bite mark evidence left on a woman's breast. DNA evidence later implicated another man and Krone was released from prison.\n[\n43\n]\nSimilarly, Roy Brown was convicted of murder due in part to bite-mark evidence, and freed after DNA testing of the saliva left in the bite wounds matched someone else.\n[\n38\n]\nAlthough bite mark analysis has been used in legal proceedings since 1870, it remains a controversial topic due to a variety of factors. DeVore\n[\n44\n]\nand Barbenel and Evans\n[\n45\n]\nhave shown that the accuracy of a bite mark on the skin is limited at best. Skin is not a good medium for dental impressions; it is liable to several of irregularities present before the imprint that could cause distortion. Also, bite marks can be altered through stretching, movement, or a changing environment during and after the actual bite. Furthermore, the level of distortion tends to increase after the bite mark was made. Both studies suggest that for the bite mark to be accurately analyzed, the body must be examined in the same position it was in when the bite occurred, which can be a difficult if the not impossible task to accomplish.\n[\n46\n]\nBite mark distortion can rarely be quantified. Therefore, bite marks found at the scene are often analyzed under the assumption that they have undergone minimal distortion.\n[\n19\n]\nOnly limited research has been done in trying to quantify the level of distortion of a bite mark on human skin since the 1970s. The lack of research may largely be because such studies are difficult to organize and are very expensive.\n[\n46\n]\nBite mark analysis is also controversial because dental profiles are subject to change. The loss of teeth or the alteration of arch configuration through a variety of procedures is common in human populations. The onset of oral diseases such as dental caries has been shown to alter the arch and tooth configuration and must be taken into account when comparing a dental profile to the bite mark after a significant amount of time has passed since the mark was made.\n[\n19\n]\nWhile the methods behind collecting bite mark evidence at the scene are leading toward greater standardization, the methodology behind analyzing bite marks is extremely variable because it depends upon the preference of the specific odontologist. As discussed earlier, there are several methods used to compare bite marks ranging from life-sized photographs to computer-enhanced three-dimensional imaging. These methods vary in precision and accuracy, and there is no set standard by which to compare or analyze them.\n[\n46\n]\nThe lack of analytical standards leads to a wide array of interpretations with any bite mark evidence. Some odontologists even disagree on whether or not a mark on the body is the result of a bite.\n[\n19\n]\nTherefore, the interpretation of evidence lies largely on the expertise of the forensic odontologist handling the case.\nOne possible issue facing bite mark analysis is a lack of bite mark uniqueness in any given population. Bite mark analysis is based on the assumption that the dental characteristics of anterior teeth involved in biting are unique amongst individuals, and this asserted uniqueness is transferred and recorded in the injury.\n[\n46\n]\nHowever, there is very little reliable research to support these assumptions. A study performed by MacFarlane et al.\n[\n47\n]\nsupported the notion of dental uniqueness, but the study revolved around the visual assessment of a cast as opposed to the bite mark that could have been produced by the cast.\n[\n46\n]\nIn another study conducted by Sognnaes et al., the group tried to find uniqueness between the dental profiles of identical twins in an attempt to prove dental uniqueness in the general population.\n[\n48\n]\nHowever, this study suffered from a small sample size (n=5), with the intent to extrapolate the data to the general population. They also used plaster of Paris as the substrate to simulate skin, yet the two materials have very different properties.\n[\n46\n]\nIn a review conducted by Strom, he references a study conducted by Berg and Schaidt which suggested that at least four to five teeth need to be present in the mark to ensure its uniqueness and make an identification.\n[\n49\n]\n[\n50\n]\nHowever, this study was done long before many of the current evaluation methods, and this sheds doubt on how applicable these conclusions are today.\nRawson et al. determined that if five teeth marks can be matched to five teeth, it can be said with confidence that only one person could have caused the bite, and if eight teeth were matched to marks this would be a certainty. However, in this study, the probabilities used to make this claim are based on the assumption that the position of each tooth was independent of all the others.\n[\n51\n]\n[\n46\n]\nThis is probably unrealistic because there are several ways that the dental profile can be changed. For example, braces apply force to specific teeth, in order to shift the placement of multiple teeth.\nOne particular case that highlighted the lack of uniqueness in bite marks involved two suspects accused of attacking a man who had sustained a bite mark injury.\n[\n52\n]\nTwo separate forensic dentists, one representing the prosecution and one the defense, were brought in to analyze the mark. They reported conflicting results. One found the mark to come from suspect A and the other said it was from suspect B. This disagreement resulted from the fact that even though the two suspects had dental features making them unique, the bite mark itself was not detailed enough to reflect them. Therefore, the mark could have reasonably come from either of the men.\n[\n52\n]\nThe equivocal outcome demonstrated in the case emphasizes the difficulty in proving uniqueness.\nMost of the controversies facing bite mark analysis are due to the lack of empirical supporting evidence. When searching the entire MedLine database from 1960 to 1999, only 50 papers in English were found that related to bite mark analysis. Of these 50 papers, most of which were published in the 1980s, only 8% came from well designed experimentation providing empirical data. The lack of research has led to the continued use of a few outdated and limited studies to support the validity of bite mark analysis. This brings into question whether or not there is enough scientific support for bite mark analysis to be employed in court.\n[\n52\n]\nThere have been several instances when forensic dentists have made claims, accusations, and guarantees supported by bite mark evaluation that have been proven incorrect through other forensic sciences. DNA analysis has shed some light on the limitations of bite mark analysis because often the DNA from saliva surrounding the area of the bite mark proves to be a more reliable form of identification. In the case of\nMississippi vs. Bourne\n, the DNA of a suspect excluded them from the crime after a dentist claimed the bite marks on the victim matched the defendant's teeth.\n[\n18\n]\nDNA sampling has been included as a task for a forensic odontologist. For a crime scene investigator, taking DNA samples is as common as taking pictures of the scene.\n[\n53\n]\nIn the case of\nState vs. Krone\n, the defendant was sentenced to death, which was overturned. Then Krone was later reconvicted and given life in prison. Both convictions were based largely on bite mark evidence, but ten years later DNA evidence surfaced that identified the real killer and Krone was set free.\n[\n18\n]\nBite marks were a primary source of evidence in the wrongful convictions of\nKeith Allen Harward\n,\n[\n54\n]\n[\n55\n]\nKennedy Brewer\n[\n56\n]\n[\n57\n]\nand\nLevon Brooks\n.\n[\n58\n]\n[\n59\n]\nThe role of bite marks in their convictions is told in a\nNetflix\nseries titled\nThe Innocence Files\n[\n60\n]\nDental Age Estimation\n[\nedit\n]\nWhen trustworthy birth records are either unavailable or contested,\nDental Age Estimation\n(DAE) is a scientific method for estimating an individual's age. It is frequently used in criminal investigations, immigration and asylum proceedings, and\ndisaster victim identification\n, among other forensic, medico-legal, and humanitarian contexts. Because of their consistent development and resilience to environmental and postmortem alterations, teeth are regarded as extremely dependable markers. In addition to skeletal and chronological age, dental age is evaluated using a variety of techniques based on the age group and available data.\nIn 2026 the volume\nDental Age Assessment: A Global Perspective\nwas published by\nSpringer Publishers\n, comprising 20 chapters reviewing established and emerging techniques and reflecting current international practices and future directions in the field.\n.\nSex estimation\n[\nedit\n]\nThe determination of sex is important in the identification of unknown individuals in both forensic and archaeological contexts. The preferred anatomical methods for sex determination are based on pelvic and cranio-facial morphology. Using these parts of the skeleton, males and females can be correctly classified with over 90% accuracy.\n[\n61\n]\nHowever, these skeletal elements are sometimes recovered in a fragmentary state, rendering sex estimation difficult. Moreover, there is currently no reliable method of sex determination of juvenile or sub-adult remains from cranial or post-cranial skeletal elements since dimorphic traits only become apparent after puberty, and this represents a fundamental problem in forensic investigations. In such situations, teeth are potentially useful in sex determination. Due to their hardness, they are highly resistant to taphonomic processes and are much more likely to be recovered than other parts of the fact, the enamel present on teeth is the hardest biological substance in the human body;\n[\n62\n]\ntherefore making them extremely sustainable analytical evidence in a forensic context. Moreover, teeth may be particularly useful for sexing immature skeletal remains since both primary and permanent sets of teeth develop before puberty.\n[\n63\n]\n[\n64\n]\nFor several decades research has been conducted into human dental sexual dimorphism, looking at different tooth classes, and using various techniques and measurements, to try to establish the extent of any dimorphism and find criteria or patterns that might enable accurate sexing of unknown individuals. Most of these studies have focused on sexual dimorphism in crown-size dimensions. This research has established that human teeth are sexually dimorphic and, although males and females exhibit overlapping dimensions, there are significant differences in mean values.\n[\n65\n]\n[\n66\n]\nSexual dimorphism has been observed in both deciduous and permanent dentition, although it is much less in deciduous teeth.\n[\n67\n]\n[\n68\n]\nOn average, male teeth are slightly larger than female teeth, with the greatest difference observed in the canine teeth.\n[\n69\n]\n[\n70\n]\nResearch using microtomographic scans to look at internal dental tissues has also shown that male teeth consist of significantly greater quantities of dentine than female teeth.\n[\n71\n]\n[\n72\n]\nThis results in female teeth having thicker enamel, on average. Researchers have attempted to use statistical techniques such as discriminant functions or logistic regression equations based on these sex differences to estimate the usefulness of such formulae is uncertain because sexual dimorphism in teeth may vary between populations.\n[\n73\n]\n[\n72\n]\n[\n66\n]\nThe advanced methods which amplify the DNA by using Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) give 100% success in sex determination.\n[\n74\n]\nSex estimation based on dentition remains experimental and has yet to gain widespread acceptance. Nevertheless, it offers potentially useful additional techniques that could be used alongside more established methods.\nIdentification methods\n[\nedit\n]\nRadiograph comparison\n[\nedit\n]\nThe comparison of antemortem and post-mortem radiographic records can be done to attain a positive identification of an individual. Teeth are used since they are a very durable and resistant to extreme conditions. The\nradiographs\ncan present dental restorations as well as unique morphology for each individual.\n[\n75\n]\nDental patterns are unique due to the variety of treatments as well as growth for each individual, which creates a benefit in using them for human identification\n[\n76\n]\nPost-mortem radiographs can be taken at the scene or in a laboratory, the antemortem records are collected from dentists’ existing files and are used for comparison with the radiographs taken from the deceased unknown individual.\n[\n77\n]\nIt is important that dentists keep all radiographs stored properly since the original dental records will be used during this comparison.\nThe antemortem and post-mortem radiographs will both be analyzed and transcribed onto Victim Identification forms and loaded into a computer database in order to compare many different antemortem records to the post-mortem in order to obtain a match.\n[\n78\n]\nRadiograph comparison is often a method used in mass fatalities for example natural disasters but It can be used in any case.\nDNA extraction\n[\nedit\n]\nTeeth contain a great source of DNA since they are very chemically and physically resistant to extreme conditions.\n[\n79\n]\nThis method is especially useful in cases where other DNA sources are not accessible, for example in burned victims. Teeth can be used to create a\nDNA profile\nin order to identify unknown deceased individuals. Dentin and enamel provide a resistant and protective surface that houses the dental pulp which is located under the enamel and dentin layers in the center of the tooth, which contains the nerves and blood supply as well.\n[\n79\n]\nWithin the pulp is where\ngenomic\nand\nmitochondrial DNA\ncan be extracted.\n[\n80\n]\nThe teeth should not be completely destroyed using DNA analysis alone, it should be compared with other techniques as well before damaging techniques are used.\nSmile photographs comparison\n[\nedit\n]\nIn cases where the body is in an advanced stage of decomposition, such as in cases of skeletal remains and charring, and considering the difficulties or impossibility of using fingerprint analysis and the high cost of DNA testing, forensic dentistry can play an important role in identification.\n[\n81\n]\n[\n82\n]\nThe most common means used for ante-mortem comparison are X-rays, dental models, and dental records. However, there are cases where the presumed victim never visited a dentist or the family cannot obtain the aforementioned sources, complicating the odontolegal identification of the victim. Another source of comparison can be photographs of the presumed victim's smile (ante-mortem) compared to photographs of the deceased person's smile (post-mortem), which can highlight the dental characteristics present and, if consistent, confirm the victim's identification.\n[\n81\n]\n[\n82\n]\n[\n83\n]\n[\n84\n]\nHowever, it is important to pay attention to details that are important in the process, such as the techniques that will be used for the comparison. Two main techniques are generally employed (both of which require the forensic dentist to take photographs of the deceased person's smile, which can then be compared to the ante-mortem photographs):\n[\n82\n]\n[\n85\n]\nDirect comparison of the characteristics presents in the ante-mortem photograph with the observed characteristics in the deceased person. In this technique, the ante-mortem and post-mortem photographs must be paired, and the dental characteristics found should be compared, described, and noted.\nComputerized outlining of the incisal edges of the teeth in the ante-mortem and post-mortem photographs. In this technique, the expert analyzes the morphology of the smile line, delineating the incisal edges and comparing them.\nTo achieve this, attention must be given to important details, such as:\n[\n82\n]\n[\n86\n]\nBoth the ante-mortem and post-mortem photographs need to be as clear as possible, with good/excellent quality.\nThe post-mortem photograph should be taken at the same angle of incidence as the ante-mortem photograph.\nThe more visible teeth in the ante-mortem photograph, the better. Therefore, selecting the best photograph obtained is important.\nThe use of software to annotate the characteristics present in the ante-mortem and post-mortem photographs, facilitating the visualization of comparative elements for everyone, including laypeople.\nIt is important to emphasize that each person's smile is unique, just like fingerprints, palatal rugae, and DNA. Therefore, when properly applied with the necessary scientific rigor, identification through photographs of the smile becomes a reliable method to establish an identification.\n[\n84\n]\n[\n87\n]\n[\n88\n]\n[\n89\n]\nPalatal rugoscopy comparison\n[\nedit\n]\nThis method of identification involves the analysis and comparison of palatal rugae from the deceased with the palatal rugae of the potential victim. One way to perform this comparison is by creating a mold of the upper arch of the deceased (capturing the palatal rugae) or using a complete upper denture that belonged to the deceased, or on a plaster model for dental purposes, and in an object containing the palatal rugae of the missing person during their lifetime (such as an old complete upper denture in possession of the family). Once the two plaster models are created, they should be scanned/photographed, and a computerized delineation of the palatal rugae should be performed, analyzing each individual ruga and comparing their location, shape, and pattern in each of the photos (of the models).\n[\n90\n]\n[\n91\n]\n[\n92\n]\nIf there is a match, the victim can be identified. It is important to note that the use of dentures for this identification can be done if the palatal rugae are clearly visible. The impression of palatal rugae in dental prostheses is formed over several years of use by the individual. This method has a significant impact on the identification process, particularly when other methodologies and identification techniques cannot be implemented.\n[\n90\n]\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nAmerican Society of Forensic Odontology\nHair analysis\nInnocence Project\nComparative dental analysis\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\na\nb\nPretty IA (May 2006). \"The barriers to achieving an evidence base for bitemark analysis\".\nForensic Science International\n.\n159\n(Suppl 1):\nS110–\nS120.\ndoi\n:\n10.1016/j.forsciint.2006.02.033\n.\nPMID\n16540273\n.\n^\nAndersen L, Juhl M, Solheim T, Borrman H (1995). \"Odontological identification of fire victims--potentialities and limitations\".\nInternational Journal of Legal Medicine\n.\n107\n(5):\n229–\n234.\ndoi\n:\n10.1007/BF01245479\n.\nPMID\n7632598\n.\nS2CID\n969604\n.\n^\na\nb\nCommittee on Identifying the Needs of the Forensic Sciences Community, Technology, and Law Committee on Science, Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics, Policy and Global Affairs, Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences, National Research Council (2009-07-29).\nStrengthening Forensic Science in the United States\n.\ndoi\n:\n10.17226/12589\n.\nISBN\n978-0-309-13130-8\n.\n^\nPress R (October 11, 2022).\n\"Forensic Bitemark Analysis Not Supported by Sufficient Data, NIST Draft Review Finds\"\n.\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology\n(Press release)\n.

This term, also known as molecular photofitting, is primarily used to refer to the prediction of a person's physical appearance and/or biogeographic ancestry for forensic purposes.\nDNA phenotyping uses many of the same scientific methods as those being used for genetically informed\npersonalized medicine\n, in which drug responsiveness (\npharmacogenomics\n) and medical outcomes are predicted from a patient's genetic information.  Significant genetic variants associated with a particular trait are discovered using a\ngenome-wide association study\n(GWAS) approach, in which hundreds of thousands or millions of\nsingle-nucleotide polymorphisms\n(SNPs) are tested for their association with each trait of interest.\nPredictive modeling\nis then used to build a mathematical model for making trait predictions about new subjects.\nPredicted phenotypes\n[\nedit\n]\nHuman phenotypes are predicted from DNA using direct or indirect methods.\n[\n1\n]\nWith direct methods, genetic variants mechanistically linked with variable expression of the relevant phenotypes are measured and used with appropriate statistical methodologies to infer trait value.  With indirect methods, variants associated with genetic component(s) of ancestry that correlate with the phenotype of interest, such as\nAncestry Informative Markers\n, are measured and used with appropriate statistical methodologies to infer trait value. The direct method is always preferable, for obvious reasons, but depending on the\ngenetic architecture\nof the phenotype, is not always possible.\n[\n1\n]\nBiogeographic ancestry determination methods have been highly developed within the genetics community, as it is a key GWAS quality control step.\n[\n2\n]\nThese approaches typically use genome-wide human genetic clustering and/or\nprincipal component analysis\nto compare new subjects to curated individuals with known ancestry, such as the\nInternational HapMap Project\nor the\n1000 Genomes Project\n.  Another approach is to assay\nancestry informative markers\n(AIMs), SNPs that vary in frequency between the major human populations.\n[\n3\n]\nAs early as 2004, evidence was compiled showing that the bulk of phenotypic variation in human iris color could be attributed to polymorphisms in the OCA2 gene.\n[\n4\n]\nThis paper, and the work it cited, laid the foundation for the inference of human iris color from DNA, first carried out on basic level by\nDNAPrint Genomics\n[\n1\n]\nBeginning in 2009, academic groups developed and reported on more accurate predictive models for eye color and, more recently, hair color in the European population.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n6\n]\nMore recently, companies such as\nParabon NanoLabs\nand Identitas have begun offering forensic DNA phenotyping services for U.S. and international law enforcement.\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\nHowever, the science behind the commercial services offered by\nParabon NanoLabs\nhas been criticized as it has not been subjected to scrutiny in peer-reviewed scientific publications. It has been suggested that it is not known \"whether their ability to estimate a face’s appearance is better than chance, or if it’s an approximation based on what we know about ancestry”.\n[\n9\n]\nDNA phenotyping is often referred to as a \"biologic witness,\" a play on the term\neye-witness\n.\n[\n10\n]\nJust as an eye-witness may describe the appearance of a person of interest, the DNA left at a crime scene can be used to discover the physical appearance of the person who left it. This allows DNA phenotyping to be used as an investigative tool to help guide the police when searching for suspects. DNA phenotyping can be particularly helpful in cold cases, where there may not be a current lead. However, it is not a method used to help incarcerate suspects, as more traditional forensic measures are better suited for this.\n[\n11\n]\nPigmentation Prediction\n[\nedit\n]\nOne online tool available to the public and law enforcement is the HIrisPlex-S Webtool.\n[\n12\n]\nThis system uses\nSNPs\nthat are linked to human pigmentation to predict an individual's\nphenotype\n. Using the multiplex assay described in three separate papers, the\ngenotype\nfor 41 different SNPs can be generated, which are linked to hair, eye and skin color in humans.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n14\n]\n[\n6\n]\nThe genotype can then be entered into the HIrisPlex-S Webtool\n[\n12\n]\nto generate the most probable phenotype of an individual based on their genetic information.no\nThis tool originally started as the IrisPlex System, consisting of six SNPs linked to eye color (rs12913832, rs1800407, rs12896399, rs16891982, rs1393350 and rs12203592).\n[\n13\n]\nThe addition of 18 SNPs linked to both hair and eye color lead to the updated HIrisPlex System (rs312262906, rs11547464, rs885479, rs1805008, rs1805005, rs1805006, rs1805007, rs1805009, rs201326893, rs2228479, rs1110400, rs28777, rs12821256, rs4959270, rs1042602, rs2402130, rs2378249 and rs683).\n[\n13\n]\nAnother assay was developed using 17 SNPs involved in skin pigmentation to create the current HIris-SPlex System (s3114908, rs1800414, rs10756819, rs2238289, rs17128291, rs6497292, rs1129038, rs1667394, rs1126809, rs1470608, rs1426654, rs6119471, rs1545397, rs6059655, rs12441727, rs3212355 and rs8051733).\n[\n6\n]\nThe predictions for eye pigmentation are Blue, Intermediate and Brown. There are two categories for hair pigmentation: color (Blond, Brown, Red and Black) and shade (light and dark). The predictions for skin pigmentation are Very Pale, Pale, Intermediate, Dark and Dark to Black. Unlike eye and hair predictions where only the highest probability is used to make a prediction, the top two highest probabilities for skin color are used to account for tanning ability and other variations.\nGenes responsible for facial features\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 2018, researchers found 15 loci in which genes are found that are responsible for our facial features.\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\nDifferences from DNA profiling\n[\nedit\n]\nTraditional\nDNA profiling\n, sometimes referred to as DNA fingerprinting, uses DNA as a\nbiometric\nidentifier.  Like an iris scan or fingerprint, a DNA profile can uniquely identify an individual with very high accuracy.  For forensic purposes, this means that investigators must have already identified and obtained DNA from a potentially matching individual.  DNA phenotyping is used when investigators need to narrow the pool of possible individuals or identify unknown remains by learning about the person's ancestry and appearance.  When the suspected individual is identified, traditional DNA profiling can be used to prove a match, provided there is a reference sample that can be used for comparison.\nPublished DNA phenotyping composites\n[\nedit\n]\nOn 9 January 2015, the fourth anniversary of the murders of Candra Alston and her three-year-old daughter Malaysia Boykin, police in Columbia, South Carolina, issued a press release containing what is thought to be the first composite image in forensic history to be published entirely on the basis of a DNA sample.\n[\n17\n]\n[\n18\n]\nThe image, produced by Parabon NanoLabs with the company's Snapshot DNA Phenotyping System, consists of a digital mesh of predicted face morphology overlaid with textures representing predicted eye color, hair color and skin color. Kenneth Canzater Jr. was charged with the murders in 2017.\n[\n19\n]\nOn 30 June 2015, NBC Nightly News featured a DNA phenotyping composite, also produced by Parabon, of a suspect in the 1988 murder of\nApril Tinsley\nnear Fort Wayne, Indiana.\n[\n20\n]\nThe television segment also included a composite of national news correspondent Kate Snow, which was produced using DNA extracted from the rim of a water bottle that the network submitted to Parabon for a blinded test of the company's Snapshot™ DNA Phenotyping Service.  Snow's identity and her use of the bottle were revealed only after the composite had been produced. In 2018 John D. Miller was charged with the murder.\n[\n21\n]\nSheriff Tony Mancuso of the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff's Office in Lake Charles, Louisiana, held a press conference on 1 September 2015 to announce the release of a Parabon Snapshot composite for a suspect in the 2009 murder of Sierra Bouzigard in Moss Bluff, Louisiana.\n[\n22\n]\nThe investigation had previously focused on a group of Hispanic males with whom Bouzigard was last seen.  Snapshot analysis indicates the suspect is predominantly European, with fair skin, green or possibly blue eyes and brown or black hair.  Sheriff Mancuso told the media, “This totally redirects our whole investigation and will move this case in a new direction.”\n[\n23\n]\nBlake A. Russell was charged with the murder in 2017.\n[\n24\n]\nFlorida police chiefs from Miami Beach, Miami, Coral Gables and Miami-Dade jointly released a Snapshot composite of the “Serial Creeper” on 10 September 2015.\n[\n25\n]\nFor more than a year, the perpetrator has been spying on and sexually terrorizing women, and police believe he is connected to at least 15 crimes, possibly as many as 40.  In a Miami Beach attack on 18 August 2015, which was first reported to the public on 23 September 2015, the perpetrator spoke in Spanish and told his victim he was from Cuba.\n[\n26\n]\nConsistent with this claim, Snapshot had previously determined that the subject is Latino, with European, Native American, and African ancestry, an admixture most similar to that found in Latino individuals from the Caribbean and Northern South America.\nOn 2 February 2016, the\nAnne Arundel County Maryland\nPolice Department released what is believed to be the first published composite created by combining DNA phenotyping and forensic facial reconstruction from a victim's skull.\n[\n27\n]\nThe victim's body which had suffered severe upper body trauma was found on 23 April 1985 in a metal trash container at the construction site of the Marley Station Mall in\nGlen Burnie, MD\n.  Police initially estimated the homicide occurred approximately five months before the body was discovered.  Later the date of death was changed to about 1963. Thom Shaw, an\nIAI-certified\nforensic artist at Parabon NanoLabs, performed the physical facial reconstruction and the digital adaptation of a Snapshot composite to reflect details gleaned from the victim's facial morphology. In 2019, with the help of Parabon and genetic genealogy, the body was identified as Roger Kelso, born in\nFort Wayne, Indiana\nin 1943. The murderer was not identified.\n[\n28\n]\nPolice in Tacoma, Washington, disclosed Parabon Snapshot reports to the public on 6 April 2016 for two male suspects believed to be individually responsible for the deaths of Michella Welch (age 12) and Jennifer Bastian (age 13), both abducted from Tacoma's North End area in 1986, just four months apart.\n[\n29\n]\nInvestigators long believed one person committed both crimes because of their many similarities. However, 2016 DNA testing proved two individuals were separately involved.  Snapshot descriptions of the two killers were released to aid the public in generating new leads for the investigations. In 2018 Gary Charles Hartman\n[\n30\n]\n[\n31\n]\nand Robert D. Washburn were charged with the murders of the two girls.\n[\n32\n]\nIn 2019 Washington State passed a law called \"Jennifer and Michella's law\" named after the two murdered girls.  This law allowed police to take DNA samples from people convicted of indecent exposure and from dead sex offenders.\n[\n33\n]\nAlso on 6 April 2016, police in Athens Ohio released a Snapshot composite of an active sexual predator linked to at least three attacks, the most recent in December 2015 near Ohio University.\n[\n34\n]\nOn 15 April 2016, the Hallandale Beach Florida Police Department released a Snapshot composite of a suspect believed to be responsible for the murders of Toronto residents David “Donny” Pichosky and Rochelle Wise.  It was the first time a Snapshot composite of a female was released to the public.\n[\n35\n]\nOn 21 April 2016, police in Windsor, Canada, released a Snapshot composite of the suspect responsible for the abduction and murder of Ljubica Topic in 1971.\n[\n36\n]\nIt was the first public release of a Snapshot composite outside of the United States and, at the time, the oldest case to which the technology had been applied.\nOn 11 May, the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office in Virginia released a Snapshot composite of a suspect responsible for abducting and sexually assaulting a 9-year-old girl in 1987.\n[\n37\n]\nOn 16 May 2016, eve of the third anniversary of veteran John “Jack” Fay's murder, the Warwick Rhode Island Police Department released a Snapshot composite produced using DNA taken from a hammer found near the crime scene.\n[\n38\n]\nPolice hoped the composite would generate fresh leads in a case that may have involved multiple assailants.\nOn 3 May 2017 Idaho Falls, Idaho Police released a DNA phenotype composite sketch from DNA found at the murder scene of Angie Dodge on 13 June 1996. Police hoped the widespread distribution of the composite sketch would generate new leads into the suspect. Excerpt from Idaho Falls Police Department Press release: \"The crime scene and evidence collected at the scene, including the collection and extraction of one major and two minor DNA profiles, indicates that there was more than one individual involved in the death of Angie Dodge. With current technologies, the major profile collected is the only viable DNA sample that can be used to make an identification.\"\n[\n39\n]\nChristopher Tapp was released in 2017 after spending 20 years in jail for taking part in the rape and murder of Angie Dodge although his DNA did not match DNA at the crime scene.\n[\n40\n]\nIn May 2019 Brian Leigh Dripps confessed to the murder of Dodge after\nIdaho Falls, Idaho\nPolice charged Dripps. Dripps DNA matched DNA left at the crime scene.\nParabon Nanolabs\nhad helped investigate this case using DNA genetic genealogy and\nGEDmatch\n.\n[\n41\n]\n[\n42\n]\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nDNA\nPhenotype\nGenotyping\nGenome-wide association study\nSingle-nucleotide polymorphisms\nPredictive modeling\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\na\nb\nc\nFrudakis, T.N.

DNA analysis intended to identify a species, rather than an individual, is called\nDNA barcoding\n.\nDNA profiling is a\nforensic\ntechnique in\ncriminal investigations\n, comparing criminal suspects' profiles to DNA evidence so as to assess the likelihood of their involvement in the crime.\n[\n1\n]\n[\n2\n]\nIt is also used in\npaternity testing\n,\n[\n3\n]\nto establish immigration eligibility,\n[\n4\n]\nand in\ngenealogical\nand medical research. DNA profiling has also been used in the study of animal and plant populations in the fields of zoology, botany, and agriculture.\n[\n5\n]\nDNA profiling was discovered by British geneticist Sir Alec Jeffreys in 1984 while he was working at the University of Leicester. He developed the technique of genetic fingerprinting by realizing that some regions of DNA have highly variable repetitive sequences that are unique to each individual.\nBackground\n[\nedit\n]\nSir\nAlec Jeffreys\n, pioneer of DNA profiling. His discovery led to the conviction of\nColin Pitchfork\nin 1988.\n[\n1\n]\nStarting in the mid 1970s, scientific advances allowed the use of DNA as a material for the identification of an individual. The first patent covering the direct use of DNA variation for forensics (\nUS5593832A\n[\n6\n]\n) was issued in 1997, continued from an application first filed by\nJeffrey Glassberg\nin 1983, based upon work he had done while at\nRockefeller University\nin the United States in 1981.\nBritish\ngeneticist Sir\nAlec Jeffreys\nindependently developed a process for DNA profiling in 1984 while working in the Department of Genetics at the\nUniversity of Leicester\n. Jeffreys discovered that a DNA examiner could establish patterns in unknown DNA. These patterns were a part of inherited traits that could be used to advance the field of relationship analysis. These discoveries led to the first use of DNA profiling in a criminal case.\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\n[\n10\n]\nThe process, developed by Jeffreys in conjunction with Peter Gill and Dave Werrett of the\nForensic Science Service\n(FSS), was first used forensically in the solving of the murder of two teenagers who had been raped and murdered in\nNarborough, Leicestershire\nin 1983 and 1986. In the murder inquiry, led by Detective David Baker, the DNA contained within blood samples obtained voluntarily from around 5,000 local men who willingly assisted\nLeicestershire Constabulary\nwith the investigation, resulted in the exoneration of Richard Buckland, an initial suspect who had confessed to one of the crimes, and the subsequent conviction of\nColin Pitchfork\non January 2, 1988. Pitchfork, a local bakery employee, had coerced his coworker Ian Kelly to stand in for him when providing a blood sample—Kelly then used a forged passport to impersonate Pitchfork. Another coworker reported the deception to the police. Pitchfork was arrested, and his blood was sent to Jeffreys' lab for processing and profile development. Pitchfork's profile matched that of DNA left by the murderer which confirmed Pitchfork's presence at both crime scenes; he pleaded guilty to both murders.\n[\n11\n]\nAfter some years, a chemical company named\nImperial Chemical Industries\n(ICI) introduced the first ever commercially available kit to the world. Despite being a relatively recent field, it had a significant global influence on both criminal justice system and society.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nVariations of\nVNTR\nallele lengths in 6 individuals\nAlthough 99.9% of human DNA sequences are the same in every person, enough of the DNA is different that it is possible to distinguish one individual from another, unless they are\nmonozygotic (identical) twins\n.\n[\n12\n]\nDNA profiling uses repetitive sequences that are highly variable,\n[\n12\n]\ncalled\nvariable number tandem repeats\n(VNTRs), in particular short tandem repeats (STRs), also known as\nmicrosatellites\n, and\nminisatellites\n. VNTR\nloci\nare similar between closely related individuals, but are so variable that unrelated individuals are unlikely to have the same VNTRs.\nBefore VNTRs and STRs, people like Jeffreys used a process called\nrestriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)\n. This process regularly used large portions of DNA to analyze the differences between two DNA samples. RFLP was among the first technologies used in DNA profiling and analysis. However, as technology has evolved, new technologies, like STR, emerged and took the place of older technology like RFLP.\n[\n13\n]\nThe admissibility of DNA evidence in courts was disputed in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s, but has since become more universally accepted due to improved techniques.\n[\n14\n]\nProfiling processes\n[\nedit\n]\nDNA extraction\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nDNA extraction\nWhen a sample such as\nblood\nor\nsaliva\nis obtained, the DNA is only a small part of what is present in the sample. Before the DNA can be analyzed, it must be\nextracted\nfrom the cells and purified. There are many ways this can be accomplished, but all methods follow the same basic procedure. The cell and nuclear membranes need to be broken up to allow the DNA to be free in solution. Once the DNA is free, it can be separated from all other cellular components. After the DNA has been separated in solution, the remaining cellular debris can then be removed from the solution and discarded, leaving only DNA. The most common methods of DNA extraction include\norganic extraction\n(also called\nphenol–chloroform extraction\n),\n[\n15\n]\nChelex extraction\n, and\nsolid-phase extraction\n.\nDifferential extraction\nis a modified version of extraction in which DNA from two different types of cells can be separated from each other before being purified from the solution. Each method of extraction works well in the laboratory, but analysts typically select their preferred method based on factors such as the cost, the time involved, the quantity of DNA yielded, and the quality of DNA yielded.\n[\n16\n]\n[\n17\n]\nRFLP analysis\n[\nedit\n]\nRestriction Fragment Length Polymorphism\nRFLP stands for restriction fragment length polymorphism and, in terms of DNA analysis, describes a DNA testing method which utilizes restriction\nenzymes\nto \"cut\" the DNA at short and specific sequences throughout the sample. To start off processing in the laboratory, the sample has to first go through an extraction protocol, which may vary depending on the sample type or laboratory SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures). Once the DNA has been \"extracted\" from the cells within the sample and separated away from extraneous cellular materials and any nucleases that would degrade the DNA, the sample can then be introduced to the desired restriction enzymes to be cut up into discernable fragments. Following the enzyme digestion, a Southern Blot is performed.\nSouthern Blots\nare a size-based separation method that are performed on a gel with either radioactive or chemiluminescent probes. RFLP could be conducted with single-locus or multi-locus probes (probes which target either one location on the DNA or multiple locations on the DNA). Incorporating the multi-locus probes allowed for higher discrimination power for the analysis, however completion of this process could take several days to a week for one sample due to the extreme amount of time required by each step required for visualization of the probes.\nMain article:\nRestriction fragment length polymorphism\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis\n[\nedit\n]\nThis technique was developed in 1983 by Kary Mullis. PCR is now a common and important technique used in medical and biological research labs for a variety of applications.\n[\n18\n]\nPCR, or Polymerase Chain Reaction, is a widely used molecular biology technique to amplify a specific DNA sequence.\nSteps of polymerase chain reaction\nAmplification is achieved by a series of three steps:\n1- Denaturation\n: In this step, the DNA is heated to 95\n°C\nto dissociate the hydrogen bonds between the complementary base pairs of the double-stranded DNA.\n2-Annealing\n: During this stage the reaction is cooled to 50-65\n°C\n. This enables the primers to attach to a specific location on the single -stranded template DNA by way of hydrogen bonding.\n3-Extension\n: A thermostable DNA polymerase which is Taq polymerase is commonly used at this step. This is done at a temperature of 72\n°C\n. DNA polymerase adds nucleotides in the 5'-3' direction and synthesizes the complementary strand of the DNA template .\nMain article:\nPolymerase chain reaction\nSTR analysis\n[\nedit\n]\nShort Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis on a simplified model: First, a DNA sample undergoes\npolymerase chain reaction\nwith\nprimers\ntargeting certain STRs (which vary in lengths between individuals and their\nalleles\n). The resultant fragments are separated by size (such as\nelectrophoresis\n).\n[\n19\n]\nMain article:\nSTR analysis\nThe system of DNA profiling used today is based on\npolymerase chain reaction\n(PCR) and uses simple sequences.\n[\n8\n]\nFrom country to country, different STR-based DNA-profiling systems are in use. In North America, systems that amplify the\nCODIS\n20\n[\n20\n]\ncore loci are almost universal, whereas in the United Kingdom the\nDNA-17\nloci system is in use, and Australia uses 18 core markers.\n[\n21\n]\nThe true power of\nSTR analysis\nis in its statistical power of discrimination. Because the 20 loci that are currently used for discrimination in CODIS are\nindependently assorted\n(having a certain number of repeats at one locus does not change the likelihood of having any number of repeats at any other locus), the\nproduct rule for probabilities\ncan be applied. This means that, if someone has the DNA type of ABC, where the three loci were independent, then the probability of that individual having that DNA type is the probability of having type A times the probability of having type B times the probability of having type C. This has resulted in the ability to generate match probabilities of 1 in a quintillion (1x10\n18\n) or more.\n[\nfurther explanation needed\n]\nHowever, DNA database searches showed much more frequent than expected false DNA profile matches.\n[\n22\n]\nY-chromosome analysis\n[\nedit\n]\nDue to the paternal inheritance, Y-haplotypes provide information about the genetic ancestry of the male population. To investigate this population history, and to provide estimates for haplotype frequencies in criminal casework, the \"Y haplotype reference database (YHRD)\" has been created in 2000 as an online resource. It currently comprises more than 300,000 minimal (8 locus) haplotypes from world-wide populations.\n[\n23\n]\nMitochondrial analysis\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMitochondrial DNA\nmtDNA can be obtained from such material as hair shafts and old bones/teeth.\n[\n24\n]\nControl mechanism based on interaction point with data. This can be determined by tooled placement in sample.\n[\n25\n]\nProfiling applications\n[\nedit\n]\nDNA profiling has been applied to the identification of microbial, fungal, plant and animal individuals. A variant of PCR,\narbitrarily amplified DNA\n, has been particularly useful in DNA fingerprinting applications. For example,\nrandom amplified polymorphic DNA\n(RAPD),\narbitrarily primed PCR\n(AP-PCR),\nDNA amplification fingerprinting\n(DAF) use arbitrary primers to target anonymous regions in a genome generating unique genetic fingerprints. These arbitrarily amplified method have been widely used for the fingerprinting of bacteria and plants, helping in forensic, breeding, and population genetic analyses. Similarly, the widely used\namplified fragment length polymorphism\n(AFLP) technique uses a combination of restriction enzymes and PCR amplification to target anonymous regions for DNA profiling of a wide range of organisms. With the advent of\nhigh-throughput sequencing\n, reduced-representation sequencing methods such as\nrestriction\nsite\nassociated DNA sequencing\n(RAD-seq) enable genome-wide marker discovery and genotyping for a wide range of applications .\nThe use of molecular marker techniques in plant fingerprinting for example allows identification of cultivars and accessions. Their use is gaining attention due to Trade Related Intellectual property rights (TRIPs) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).\n[\n26\n]\nIn particular, DNA fingerprinting of medical plants permits identification, authentication, distinction, and detection of phytoconstituents and adulteration in plants.\n[\n27\n]\nDNA profiling is becoming critical for these applications, determining the future of scientific study in pharmacognosy.\n[\n27\n]\nThe techniques also help with determining the traits (such as seed size and leaf color) that are likely to improve offspring success.\n[\n28\n]\nIssues with forensic DNA samples\n[\nedit\n]\nWhen people think of DNA analysis, they often think about television shows like\nNCIS\nor\nCSI\n, which portray DNA samples coming into a lab and being instantly analyzed, followed by the pulling up of a picture of the suspect within minutes⁠. However, the reality is quite different, and perfect DNA samples are often not collected from the scene of a crime. Homicide victims are frequently left exposed to harsh conditions before they are found, and objects that are used to commit crimes have often been handled by more than one person. The two most prevalent issues that forensic scientists encounter when analyzing DNA samples are degraded samples and DNA mixtures.\n[\n29\n]\nDegraded DNA\n[\nedit\n]\nBefore modern PCR methods existed, it was almost impossible to analyze degraded DNA samples. Methods like restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), which was the first technique used for DNA analysis in forensic science, required high molecular weight DNA in the sample in order to get reliable data. High molecular weight DNA, however, is lacking in degraded samples, as the DNA is too fragmented to carry out RFLP accurately. It was only when polymerase chain reaction techniques were invented that analysis of degraded DNA samples were able to be carried out. Multiplex PCR in particular made it possible to isolate and to amplify the small fragments of DNA that are still left in degraded samples. When multiplex PCR methods are compared to the older methods like RFLP, a vast difference can be seen. Multiplex PCR can theoretically amplify less than 1 ng of DNA, but RFLP had to have a least 100 ng of DNA in order to carry out an analysis.\n[\n30\n]\nLow-template DNA\n[\nedit\n]\nLow-template DNA can happen when there is less than 0.1 ng(\n[\n31\n]\n) of DNA in a sample. This can lead to more stochastic effects (random events) such as allelic dropout or allelic drop-in which can alter the interpretation of a DNA profile. These stochastic effects can lead to the unequal amplification of the 2 alleles that come from a heterozygous individual. It is especially important to take low-template DNA into account when dealing with a mixture of DNA sample. This is because for one (or more) of the contributors in the mixture, they are more likely to have less than the optimal amount of DNA for the PCR reaction to work properly.\n[\n32\n]\nTherefore, stochastic thresholds are developed for DNA profile interpretation. The stochastic threshold is the minimum peak height (RFU value), seen in an electropherogram where dropout occurs. If the peak height value is above this threshold, then it is reasonable to assume that allelic dropout has not occurred. For example, if only 1 peak is seen for a particular locus in the electropherogram but its peak height is above the stochastic threshold, then we can reasonably assume that this individual is homozygous and is not missing its heterozygous partner allele that otherwise would have dropped out due to having low-template DNA. Allelic dropout can occur when there is low-template DNA because there is such little DNA to start with that at this locus the contributor to the DNA sample (or mixture) is a true heterozygote but the other allele is not amplified and so it would be lost. Allelic drop-in\n[\n33\n]\ncan also occur when there is low-template DNA because sometimes the stutter peak can be amplified. The stutter is an artifact of PCR. During the PCR reaction, DNA Polymerase will come in and add nucleotides off of the primer, but this whole process is very dynamic, meaning that the DNA Polymerase is constantly binding, popping off and then rebinding. Therefore, sometimes DNA Polymerase will rejoin at the short tandem repeat ahead of it, leading to a short tandem repeat that is 1 repeat less than the template. During PCR, if DNA Polymerase happens to bind to a locus in stutter and starts to amplify it to make lots of copies, then this stutter product will appear randomly in the electropherogram, leading to allelic drop-in.\nMiniSTR analysis\n[\nedit\n]\nIn instances in which DNA samples are degraded, like if there are intense fires or all that remains are bone fragments, standard STR testing on those samples can be inadequate. When standard STR testing is done on highly degraded samples, the larger STR loci often drop out, and only partial DNA profiles are obtained. Partial DNA profiles can be a powerful tool, but the probability of a random match is larger than if a full profile was obtained. One method that has been developed to analyse degraded DNA samples is to use miniSTR technology. In the new approach, primers are specially designed to bind closer to the STR region.\n[\n34\n]\nIn normal STR testing, the primers bind to longer sequences that contain the STR region within the segment. MiniSTR analysis, however, targets only the STR location, which results in a DNA product that is much smaller.\n[\n34\n]\nBy placing the primers closer to the actual STR regions, there is a higher chance that successful amplification of this region will occur. Successful amplification of those STR regions can now occur, and more complete DNA profiles can be obtained.  The success that smaller PCR products produce a higher success rate with highly degraded samples was first reported in 1995, when miniSTR technology was used to identify victims of the Waco fire.\n[\n35\n]\nDNA mixtures\n[\nedit\n]\nMixtures are another common issue faced by forensic scientists when they are analyzing unknown or questionable DNA samples. A mixture is defined as a DNA sample that contains two or more individual contributors.\n[\n30\n]\nThat can often occur when a DNA sample is swabbed from an item that is handled by more than one person or when a sample contains both the victim's and the assailant's DNA. The presence of more than one individual in a DNA sample can make it challenging to detect individual profiles, and interpretation of mixtures should be performed only by highly trained individuals. Mixtures that contain two or three individuals can be interpreted with difficulty. Mixtures that contain four or more individuals are much too convoluted to get individual profiles. One common scenario in which a mixture is often obtained is in the case of sexual assault. A sample may be collected that contains material from the victim, the victim's consensual sexual partners, and the perpetrator(s).\n[\n36\n]\nMixtures can generally be sorted into three categories: Type A, Type B, and Type C.\n[\n37\n]\nType A mixtures have alleles with similar peak-heights all around, so the contributors cannot be distinguished from each other. Type B mixtures can be deconvoluted by comparing peak-height ratios to determine which alleles were donated together. Type C mixtures cannot be safely interpreted with current technology because the samples were affected by DNA degradation or having too small a quantity of DNA present.\nWhen looking at an electropherogram, it is possible to determine the number of contributors in less complex mixtures based on the number of peaks located in each locus. In comparison to a single source profile, which will only have one or two peaks at each locus, a mixture is when there are three or more peaks at two or more loci.\n[\n38\n]\nIf there are three peaks at only a single locus, then it is possible to have a single contributor who is tri-allelic at that locus.\n[\n39\n]\nTwo person mixtures will have between two and four peaks at each locus, and three person mixtures will have between three and six peaks at each locus. Mixtures become increasingly difficult to deconvolute as the number of contributors increases.\nAs detection methods in DNA profiling advance, forensic scientists are seeing more DNA samples that contain mixtures, as even the smallest contributor can now be detected by modern tests. The ease in which forensic scientists have in interpenetrating DNA mixtures largely depends on the ratio of DNA present from each individual, the genotype combinations, and the total amount of DNA amplified.\n[\n40\n]\nThe DNA ratio is often the most important aspect to look at in determining whether a mixture can be interpreted. For example, if a DNA sample had two contributors, it would be easy to interpret individual profiles if the ratio of DNA contributed by one person was much higher than the second person. When a sample has three or more contributors, it becomes extremely difficult to determine individual profiles. Fortunately, advancements in probabilistic genotyping may make that sort of determination possible in the future.\nProbabilistic genotyping\nuses complex computer software to run through thousands of mathematical computations to produce statistical likelihoods of individual genotypes found in a mixture.\n[\n41\n]\nDNA databases\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nNational DNA database\nAn early application of a\nDNA database\nwas the compilation of a Mitochondrial DNA Concordance,\n[\n42\n]\nprepared by Kevin W. P. Miller and John L. Dawson at the\nUniversity of Cambridge\nfrom 1996 to 1999\n[\n43\n]\nfrom data collected as part of Miller's PhD thesis. There are now several\nDNA databases\nin existence around the world. Some are private, but most of the largest databases are government-controlled. The\nUnited States\nmaintains the largest\nDNA database\n, with the\nCombined DNA Index System\n(CODIS) holding over 13 million records as of May 2018.\n[\n44\n]\nThe\nUnited Kingdom\nmaintains the\nNational DNA Database\n(NDNAD), which is of similar size, despite the UK's smaller population. The size of this database, and its rate of growth, are giving concern to\ncivil liberties\ngroups in the UK, where police have wide-ranging powers to take samples and retain them even in the event of acquittal.\n[\n45\n]\nThe Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition partially addressed these concerns with part 1 of the\nProtection of Freedoms Act 2012\n, under which DNA samples must be deleted if suspects are acquitted or not charged, except in relation to certain (mostly serious or sexual) offenses. Public discourse around the introduction of advanced forensic techniques (such as genetic genealogy using public genealogy databases and DNA phenotyping approaches) has been limited, disjointed, unfocused, and raises issues of privacy and consent that may warrant the establishment of additional legal protections.\n[\n46\n]\nThe\nU.S. Patriot Act\nof the United States provides a means for the U.S. government to get DNA samples from suspected terrorists. DNA information from crimes is collected and deposited into the\nCODIS\ndatabase, which is maintained by the\nFBI\n. CODIS enables law enforcement officials to test DNA samples from crimes for matches within the database, providing a means of finding specific biological profiles associated with collected DNA evidence.\n[\n47\n]\nWhen a match is made from a national DNA databank to link a crime scene to an offender having provided a DNA sample to a database, that link is often referred to as a\ncold hit\n. A cold hit is of value in referring the police agency to a specific suspect but is of less evidential value than a DNA match made from outside the DNA Databank.\n[\n48\n]\nFBI agents cannot legally store DNA of a person not convicted of a crime. DNA collected from a suspect not later convicted must be disposed of and not entered into the database. In 1998, a man residing in the UK was arrested on accusation of burglary. His DNA was taken and tested, and he was later released. Nine months later, this man's DNA was accidentally and illegally entered in the DNA database. New DNA is automatically compared to the DNA found at cold cases and, in this case, this man was found to be a match to DNA found at a rape and assault case one year earlier. The government then prosecuted him for these crimes. During the trial the DNA match was requested to be removed from the evidence because it had been illegally entered into the database. The request was carried out.\n[\n49\n]\nThe DNA of the perpetrator, collected from victims of rape, can be stored for years until a match is found. In 2014, to address this problem, Congress extended a bill that helps states deal with \"a backlog\" of evidence.\n[\n50\n]\nDNA profiling databases in Plants:\nPIDS:\nPIDS(Plant international DNA-fingerprinting system) is an open source web server and free software based plant international DNA fingerprinting system.\nIt manages huge amount of microsatellite DNA fingerprint data, performs genetic studies, and automates collection, storage and maintenance while decreasing human error and increasing efficiency.\nThe system may be tailored to specific laboratory needs, making it a valuable tool for plant breeders, forensic science, and human fingerprint recognition.\nIt keeps track of experiments, standardizes data and promotes inter-database communication.\nIt also helps with the regulation of variety quality, the preservation of variety rights and the use of molecular markers in breeding by providing location statistics, merging, comparison and genetic analysis function.\n[\n51\n]\nConsiderations in evaluating DNA evidence\n[\nedit\n]\nWhen using\nRFLP\n, the theoretical risk of a coincidental match is 1 in 100 billion (100,000,000,000) although the practical risk is actually 1 in 1,000 because\nmonozygotic twins\nare 0.2% of the human population.\n[\n52\n]\nMoreover, the rate of laboratory error is almost certainly higher than that and actual laboratory procedures often do not reflect the theory under which the coincidence probabilities were computed. For example, coincidence probabilities may be calculated based on the probabilities that markers in two samples have bands in\nprecisely\nthe same location, but a laboratory worker may conclude that similar but not precisely-identical band patterns result from identical genetic samples with some imperfection in the agarose gel. However, in that case, the laboratory worker increases the coincidence risk by expanding the criteria for declaring a match. Studies conducted in the 2000s quoted relatively-high error rates, which may be cause for concern.\n[\n53\n]\nIn the early days of genetic fingerprinting, the necessary population data to compute a match probability accurately was sometimes unavailable. Between 1992 and 1996, arbitrary-low ceilings were controversially put on match probabilities used in RFLP analysis, rather than the higher theoretically computed ones.\n[\n54\n]\nEvidence of genetic relationship\n[\nedit\n]\nIt is possible to use DNA profiling as evidence of genetic relationship although such evidence varies in strength from weak to positive. Testing that shows no relationship is absolutely certain. Further, while almost all individuals have a single and distinct set of genes, ultra-rare individuals, known as \"\nchimeras\n\", have at least two different sets of genes. There have been two cases of DNA profiling that falsely suggested that a mother was unrelated to her children.\n[\n55\n]\nFake DNA evidence\n[\nedit\n]\nThe functional analysis of genes and their coding sequences (\nopen reading frames\n[ORFs]) typically requires that each ORF be expressed, the encoded protein purified, antibodies produced, phenotypes examined, intracellular localization determined, and interactions with other proteins sought.\n[\n56\n]\nIn a study conducted by the life science company Nucleix and published in the journal\nForensic Science International\n, scientists found that an\nin vitro\nsynthesized sample of DNA matching any desired genetic profile can be constructed using standard\nmolecular biology\ntechniques without obtaining any actual tissue from that person.\nDNA evidence in criminal trials\n[\nedit\n]\nEvidence\nPart of the\nlaw\nseries\nTypes of evidence\nTestimony\nDocumentary\nReal (physical)\nDigital\nExculpatory\nInculpatory\nDemonstrative\nEyewitness identification\nGenetic (DNA)\nLies\nConsciousness of guilt\nDirect\nCircumstantial\nRelevance\nBurden of proof\nLaying a foundation\nMateriality\nPublic policy exclusions\nSpoliation\nCharacter\nHabit\nSimilar fact\nAuthentication\nChain of custody\nJudicial notice\nBest evidence rule\nSelf-authenticating document\nAncient document\nHague Evidence Convention\nWitnesses\nCompetence\nPrivilege\nDirect examination\nCross-examination\nRedirect\nImpeachment\nProffer agreement\nRecorded recollection\nExpert witness\nDead Man's Statute\nHearsay\nand exceptions\nin English law\nin United States law\nConfessions\nBusiness records\nExcited utterance\nDying declaration\nParty admission\nAncient document\nDeclaration against interest\nPresent sense impression\nRes gestae\nLearned treatise\nImplied assertion\nOther\ncommon law\nareas\nContract\nTort\nProperty\nWills\n,\ntrusts and estates\nCriminal law\nv\nt\ne\nFamilial DNA searching\n[\nedit\n]\nFamilial DNA searching (sometimes referred to as \"familial DNA\" or \"familial DNA database searching\") is the practice of creating new investigative leads in cases where DNA evidence found at the scene of a crime (forensic profile) strongly resembles that of an existing DNA profile (offender profile) in a state DNA database but there is not an exact match.\n[\n57\n]\n[\n58\n]\nAfter all other leads have been exhausted, investigators may use specially developed software to compare the forensic profile to all profiles taken from a state's DNA database to generate a list of those offenders already in the database who are most likely to be a very close relative of the individual whose DNA is in the forensic profile.\n[\n59\n]\nFamilial DNA database searching was first used in an investigation leading to the conviction of Jeffrey Gafoor of the\nmurder of Lynette White\nin the United Kingdom on 4 July 2003. DNA evidence was matched to Gafoor's nephew, who at 14 years old had not been born at the time of the murder in 1988. It was used again in 2004\n[\n60\n]\nto find a man who threw a brick from a motorway bridge and hit a lorry driver, killing him. DNA found on the brick matched that found at the scene of a car theft earlier in the day, but there were no good matches on the national DNA database. A wider search found a partial match to an individual; on being questioned, this man revealed he had a brother, Craig Harman, who lived very close to the original crime scene. Harman voluntarily submitted a DNA sample, and confessed when it matched the sample from the brick.\n[\n61\n]\nAs of 2011, familial DNA database searching is not conducted on a national level in the United States, where states determine how and when to conduct familial searches. The first familial DNA search with a subsequent conviction in the United States was conducted in\nDenver\n, Colorado, in 2008, using software developed under the leadership of\nDenver District Attorney\nMitch Morrissey\nand Denver Police Department Crime Lab Director Gregg LaBerge.\n[\n62\n]\nCalifornia was the first state to implement a policy for familial searching under then-Attorney General\nJerry Brown\n, who later became Governor.\n[\n63\n]\nIn his role as consultant to the Familial Search Working Group of the\nCalifornia Department of Justice\n, former\nAlameda County\nProsecutor Rock Harmon is widely considered to have been the catalyst in the adoption of familial search technology in California. The technique was used to catch the Los Angeles serial killer known as the \"\nGrim Sleeper\n\" in 2010.\n[\n64\n]\nIt was not a witness or informant that tipped off law enforcement to the identity of the \"Grim Sleeper\" serial killer, who had eluded police for more than two decades, but DNA from the suspect's own son. The suspect's son had been arrested and convicted in a felony weapons charge and swabbed for DNA the year before. When his DNA was entered into the database of convicted felons, detectives were alerted to a partial match to evidence found at the \"Grim Sleeper\" crime scenes. David Franklin Jr., also known as the Grim Sleeper, was charged with ten counts of murder and one count of attempted murder.\n[\n65\n]\nMore recently, familial DNA led to the arrest of 21-year-old Elvis Garcia on charges of sexual assault and false imprisonment of a woman in\nSanta Cruz\nin 2008.\n[\n66\n]\nIn March 2011\nVirginia\nGovernor\nBob McDonnell\nannounced that Virginia would begin using familial DNA searches.\n[\n67\n]\nAt a press conference in Virginia on 7 March 2011, regarding the\nEast Coast Rapist\n, Prince William County prosecutor Paul Ebert and Fairfax County Police Detective John Kelly said the case would have been solved years ago if Virginia had used familial DNA searching. Aaron Thomas, the suspected East Coast Rapist, was arrested in connection with the rape of 17 women from Virginia to Rhode Island, but familial DNA was not used in the case.\n[\n68\n]\nCritics of familial DNA database searches argue that the technique is an invasion of an individual's\n4th Amendment\nrights.\n[\n69\n]\nPrivacy advocates are petitioning for DNA database restrictions, arguing that the only fair way to search for possible DNA matches to relatives of offenders or arrestees would be to have a population-wide DNA database.\n[\n49\n]\nSome scholars have pointed out that the privacy concerns surrounding familial searching are similar in some respects to other police search techniques,\n[\n70\n]\nand most have concluded that the practice is constitutional.\n[\n71\n]\nThe\nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals\nin\nUnited States v. Pool\n(vacated as moot) suggested that this practice is somewhat analogous to a witness looking at a photograph of one person and stating that it looked like the perpetrator, which leads law enforcement to show the witness photos of similar looking individuals, one of whom is identified as the perpetrator.\n[\n72\n]\nCritics also state that racial profiling could occur on account of familial DNA testing. In the United States, the conviction rates of racial minorities are much higher than that of the overall population. It is unclear whether this is due to discrimination from police officers and the courts, as opposed to a simple higher rate of offence among minorities. Arrest-based databases, which are found in the majority of the United States, lead to an even greater level of racial discrimination. An arrest, as opposed to conviction, relies much more heavily on police discretion.\n[\n49\n]\nFor instance, investigators with Denver District Attorney's Office successfully identified a suspect in a property theft case using a familial DNA search. In this example, the suspect's blood left at the scene of the crime strongly resembled that of a current\nColorado Department of Corrections\nprisoner.\n[\n62\n]\nPartial matches\n[\nedit\n]\nPartial DNA matches are the result of moderate stringency CODIS searches that produce a potential match that shares at least one\nallele\nat every\nlocus\n.\n[\n73\n]\nPartial matching does not involve the use of familial search software, such as those used in the United Kingdom and the United States, or additional\nY-STR\nanalysis and therefore often misses sibling relationships. Partial matching has been used to identify suspects in several cases in both countries\n[\n74\n]\nand has also been used as a tool to exonerate the falsely accused.\nDarryl Hunt\nwas wrongly convicted in connection with the rape and the murder of a young woman in 1984 in\nNorth Carolina\n.\n[\n75\n]\nSurreptitious DNA collecting\n[\nedit\n]\nPolice forces may collect DNA samples without a suspect's knowledge, and use it as evidence. The legality of the practice has been questioned in\nAustralia\n.\n[\n76\n]\nIn the\nUnited States\n, where it has been accepted, courts often rule that there is no\nexpectation of privacy\nand cite\nCalifornia v. Greenwood\n(1988), in which the\nSupreme Court\nheld that the\nFourth Amendment\ndoes not prohibit the\nwarrantless\nsearch and seizure of\ngarbage\nleft for collection outside the\ncurtilage\nof a\nhome\n. Critics of this practice underline that this analogy ignores that \"most people have no idea that they risk surrendering their genetic identity to the police by, for instance, failing to destroy a used coffee cup. Moreover, even if they do realize it, there is no way to avoid abandoning one's DNA in public.\"\n[\n77\n]\nThe United States Supreme Court ruled in\nMaryland v. King\n(2013) that DNA sampling of prisoners arrested for serious crimes is constitutional.\n[\n78\n]\n[\n79\n]\n[\n80\n]\nIn the\nUnited Kingdom\n, the\nHuman Tissue Act 2004\nprohibits private individuals from covertly collecting biological samples (hair, fingernails, etc.) for DNA analysis but exempts medical and criminal investigations from the prohibition.\n[\n81\n]\nEngland and Wales\n[\nedit\n]\nEvidence from an expert who has compared DNA samples must be accompanied by evidence as to the sources of the samples and the procedures for obtaining the DNA profiles.\n[\n82\n]\nThe judge must ensure that the jury must understand the significance of DNA matches and mismatches in the profiles. The judge must also ensure that the jury does not confuse the match probability (the probability that a person that is chosen at random has a matching DNA profile to the sample from the scene) with the probability that a person with matching DNA committed the crime. In 1996\nR v. Doheny\n[\n83\n]\nJuries should weigh up conflicting and corroborative evidence, using their own common sense and not by using mathematical formulae, such as\nBayes' theorem\n, so as to avoid \"confusion, misunderstanding and misjudgment\".\n[\n84\n]\nPresentation and evaluation of evidence of partial or incomplete DNA profiles\n[\nedit\n]\nIn\nR v Bates\n,\n[\n85\n]\nMoore-Bick LJ said:\nWe can see no reason why partial profile DNA evidence should not be admissible provided that the jury are made aware of its inherent limitations and are given a sufficient explanation to enable them to evaluate it. There may be cases where the match probability in relation to all the samples tested is so great that the judge would consider its probative value to be minimal and decide to exclude the evidence in the exercise of his discretion, but this gives rise to no new question of principle and can be left for decision on a case by case basis. However, the fact that there exists in the case of all partial profile evidence the possibility that a \"missing\" allele might exculpate the accused altogether does not provide sufficient grounds for rejecting such evidence. In many there is a possibility (at least in theory) that evidence that would assist the accused and perhaps even exculpate him altogether exists, but that does not provide grounds for excluding relevant evidence that is available and otherwise admissible, though it does make it important to ensure that the jury are given sufficient information to enable them to evaluate that evidence properly.\n[\n86\n]\nDNA testing in the United States\n[\nedit\n]\nCBP\nchemist reads a DNA profile to determine the origin of a commodity.\nThere are state laws on DNA profiling in all 50\nstates\nof the\nUnited States\n.\n[\n87\n]\nDetailed information on database laws in each state can be found at the\nNational Conference of State Legislatures\nwebsite.\n[\n88\n]\nDevelopment of artificial DNA\n[\nedit\n]\nIn August 2009, scientists in\nIsrael\nraised serious doubts concerning the use of DNA by law enforcement as the ultimate method of identification. In a paper published in the journal\nForensic Science International: Genetics\n, the Israeli researchers demonstrated that it is possible to manufacture DNA in a laboratory, thus falsifying DNA evidence. The scientists fabricated saliva and blood samples, which originally contained DNA from a person other than the supposed donor of the blood and saliva.\n[\n89\n]\nThe researchers also showed that, using a DNA database, it is possible to take information from a profile and manufacture DNA to match it, and that this can be done without access to any actual DNA from the person whose DNA they are duplicating. The synthetic DNA\noligos\nrequired for the procedure are common in molecular laboratories.\n[\n89\n]\nThe New York Times\nquoted the lead author, Daniel Frumkin, saying, \"You can just engineer a crime scene ... any biology undergraduate could perform this\".\n[\n89\n]\nFrumkin perfected a test that can differentiate real DNA samples from fake ones. His test detects\nepigenetic\nmodifications, in particular,\nDNA methylation\n.\n[\n90\n]\nSeventy percent of the DNA in any human genome is methylated, meaning it contains\nmethyl group\nmodifications within a\nCpG dinucleotide\ncontext. Methylation at the promoter region is associated with gene silencing. The synthetic DNA lacks this\nepigenetic\nmodification, which allows the test to distinguish manufactured DNA from genuine DNA.\n[\n89\n]\nIt is unknown how many police departments, if any, currently use the test. No police lab has publicly announced that it is using the new test to verify DNA results.\n[\n91\n]\nResearchers at the University of Tokyo integrated an artificial DNA replication scheme with a rebuilt gene expression system and micro-compartmentalization utilizing cell-free materials alone for the first time. Multiple cycles of serial dilution were performed on a system contained in microscale water-in-oil droplets.\n[\n92\n]\nChances of making DNA change on purpose\nOverall, this study's artificial genomic DNA, which kept copying itself using self-encoded proteins and made its sequence better on its own, is a good starting point for making more complex artificial cells. By adding the genes needed for transcription and translation to artificial genomic DNA, it may be possible in the future to make artificial cells that can grow on their own when fed small molecules like amino acids and nucleotides. Using living organisms to make useful things, like drugs and food, would be more stable and easier to control in these artificial cells.\n[\n92\n]\nOn July 7, 2008, the American chemical society reported that Japanese chemists have created the world's first DNA molecule comprised nearly completely of synthetic components.\nA nano-particle based artificial transcription factor for gene regulation:\nNano Script is a nanoparticle-based artificial transcription factor that is supposed to replicate the structure and function of TFs. On gold nanoparticles, functional peptides and tiny molecules referred to as synthetic transcription factors, which imitate the various TF domains, were attached to create Nano Script. We show that Nano Script localizes to the nucleus and begins transcription of a reporter plasmid by an amount more than 15-fold. Moreover, Nano Script can successfully transcribe targeted genes onto endogenous DNA in a nonviral manner.\n[\n93\n]\nThree different fluorophores—red, green, and blue—were carefully fixed on the DNA rod surface to provide spatial information and create a nanoscale barcode. Epifluorescence and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy reliably deciphered spatial information between fluorophores. By moving the three fluorophores on the DNA rod, this nanoscale barcode created 216 fluorescence patterns.\n[\n94\n]\nCases\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 1986, Richard Buckland was\nexonerated\n, despite having admitted to the\nrape\nand\nmurder\nof a teenager near\nLeicester\n, the city where DNA profiling was first developed. This was the first use of DNA fingerprinting in a criminal investigation, and the first to prove a suspect's innocence.\n[\n95\n]\nThe following year\nColin Pitchfork\nwas identified as the perpetrator of the same murder, in addition to another, using the same techniques that had cleared Buckland.\n[\n96\n]\nIn 1987, genetic fingerprinting was used in a US criminal court for the first time in the trial of a man accused of\nunlawful intercourse\nwith a mentally disabled 14-year-old female who gave birth to a baby.\n[\n97\n]\nIn 1987,\nFlorida\nrapist Tommie Lee Andrews was the first person in the United States to be convicted as a result of DNA evidence, for raping a woman during a\nburglary\n; he was convicted on 6 November 1987, and sentenced to 22 years in prison.\n[\n98\n]\n[\n99\n]\nIn 1990, a violent murder of a young student in\nBrno\nwas the first criminal case in\nCzechoslovakia\nsolved by DNA evidence, with the murderer sentenced to 23 years in prison.\n[\n100\n]\n[\n101\n]\nIn 1992, DNA from a\npalo verde tree\nwas used to convict Mark Alan Bogan of murder. DNA from seed pods of a tree at the crime scene was found to match that of seed pods found in Bogan's truck.  This is the first instance of plant DNA admitted in a criminal case.\n[\n102\n]\n[\n103\n]\n[\n104\n]\nIn 1994, the claim that\nAnna Anderson\nwas\nGrand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia\nwas tested after her death using samples of her tissue that had been stored at a\nCharlottesville\nhospital following a medical procedure. The tissue was tested using DNA fingerprinting, and showed that she bore no relation to the\nRomanovs\n.\n[\n105\n]\nIn 1994,\nEarl Washington, Jr.\n, of Virginia had his death sentence commuted to life imprisonment a week before his scheduled execution date based on DNA evidence. He received a full pardon in 2000 based on more advanced testing.\n[\n106\n]\nIn 1999, Raymond Easton, a disabled man from\nSwindon\n, England, was arrested and detained for seven hours in connection with a burglary, because the on-site DNA seemed to match his. He was released when a more accurate test showed clear differences. His DNA had been retained on file after an unrelated domestic incident some time previously.\n[\n107\n]\nIn 2000 Frank Lee Smith was proved innocent by DNA profiling of the murder of an eight-year-old girl after spending 14 years on death row in Florida, USA. However he had died of\ncancer\njust before his innocence was proven.\n[\n108\n]\nIn view of this the Florida state governor ordered that in future any death row inmate claiming innocence should have DNA testing.\n[\n106\n]\nIn May 2000 Gordon Graham murdered Paul Gault at his home in\nLisburn\n, Northern Ireland. Graham was convicted of the murder when his DNA was found on a sports bag left in the house as part of an elaborate ploy to suggest the murder occurred after a burglary had gone wrong. Graham was having an affair with the victim's wife at the time of the murder. It was the first time Low Copy Number DNA was used in Northern Ireland.\n[\n109\n]\nIn 2001, Wayne Butler was convicted for the\nmurder of Celia Douty\n. It was the first murder in\nAustralia\nto be solved using DNA profiling.\n[\n110\n]\n[\n111\n]\nIn 2002, the body of\nJames Hanratty\n, hanged in 1962 for the \"A6 murder\", was exhumed and DNA samples from the body and members of his family were analysed.  The results convinced\nCourt of Appeal\njudges that Hanratty's guilt, which had been strenuously disputed by campaigners, was proved \"beyond doubt\".\n[\n112\n]\nPaul Foot and some other campaigners continued to believe in Hanratty's innocence and argued that the DNA evidence could have been contaminated, noting that the small DNA samples from items of clothing, kept in a police laboratory for over 40 years \"in conditions that do not satisfy modern evidential standards\", had had to be subjected to very new amplification techniques in order to yield any genetic profile.\n[\n113\n]\nHowever, no DNA other than Hanratty's was found on the evidence tested, contrary to what would have been expected had the evidence indeed been contaminated.\n[\n114\n]\nIn August 2002, Annalisa Vicentini was shot dead in\nTuscany\n. Bartender Peter Hamkin, 23, was arrested, in\nMerseyside\nin March 2003 on an extradition warrant heard at\nBow Street Magistrates' Court\nin\nLondon\nto establish whether he should be taken to\nItaly\nto face a murder charge. DNA \"proved\" he shot her, but he was cleared on other evidence.\n[\n115\n]\nIn 2003, Welshman Jeffrey Gafoor was convicted of the 1988\nmurder of Lynette White\n, when crime scene evidence collected 12 years earlier was re-examined using\nSTR\ntechniques, resulting in a match with his nephew.\n[\n116\n]\nIn June 2003, because of new DNA evidence, Dennis Halstead, John Kogut and John Restivo won a re-trial on their 1986 murder conviction, their convictions were struck down and they were released.\n[\n117\n]\nIn 2004, DNA testing shed new light into the mysterious 1912\ndisappearance of Bobby Dunbar\n, a four-year-old boy who vanished during a fishing trip. He was allegedly found alive eight months later in the custody of William Cantwell Walters, but another woman claimed that the boy was her son, Bruce Anderson, whom she had entrusted in Walters' custody. The courts disbelieved her claim and convicted Walters for the\nkidnapping\n. The boy was raised and known as Bobby Dunbar throughout the rest of his life. However, DNA tests on Dunbar's son and nephew revealed the two were not related, thus establishing that the boy found in 1912 was not Bobby Dunbar, whose real fate remains unknown.\n[\n118\n]\nIn 2005, Gary Leiterman was convicted of the 1969 murder of Jane Mixer, a law student at the\nUniversity of Michigan\n, after DNA found on Mixer's\npantyhose\nwas matched to Leiterman. DNA in a drop of blood on Mixer's hand was matched to John Ruelas, who was only four years old in 1969 and was never successfully connected to the case in any other way. Leiterman's defense unsuccessfully argued that the unexplained match of the blood spot to Ruelas pointed to cross-contamination and raised doubts about the reliability of the lab's identification of Leiterman.\n[\n119\n]\n[\n120\n]\nIn November 2008,\nAnthony Curcio\nwas arrested for masterminding one of the most elaborately planned armored car heists in history.  DNA evidence linked Curcio to the crime.\n[\n121\n]\nIn March 2009,\nSean Hodgson\n—convicted of 1979 killing of\nTeresa De Simone\n, 22, in her car in\nSouthampton\n—was released after tests proved DNA from the scene was not his. It was later matched to DNA retrieved from the exhumed body of David Lace. Lace had previously confessed to the crime but was not believed by the\ndetectives\n. He served time in prison for other crimes committed at the same time as the murder and then committed\nsuicide\nin 1988.\n[\n122\n]\nIn 2012, a case of babies being switched, many decades earlier, was discovered by accident. After undertaking DNA testing for other purposes, Alice Collins Plebuch was advised that her ancestry appeared to include a significant\nAshkenazi Jewish\ncomponent, despite a belief in her family that they were of predominantly\nIrish descent\n. Profiling of Plebuch's genome suggested that it included distinct and unexpected components associated with Ashkenazi,\nMiddle Eastern\n, and\nEastern European\npopulations. This led Plebuch to conduct an extensive investigation, after which she concluded that her father had been switched (possibly accidentally) with another baby soon after birth. Plebuch was also able to identify the biological ancestors of her father.\n[\n123\n]\n[\n124\n]\nIn 2015, in\nX and Anor v Z (Children) and Anor\nthe Court of Appeal for England and Wales decided that it is not lawful for a DNA profile made by the police in the course of a criminal investigation to be used for a paternity test.\nIn 2016 Anthea Ring, abandoned as a baby, was able to use a DNA sample and DNA matching database to discover her deceased mother's identity and roots in\nCounty Mayo\n, Ireland. A recently developed forensic test was subsequently used to capture DNA from saliva left on old stamps and envelopes by her suspected father, uncovered through painstaking genealogy research. The DNA in the first three samples was too degraded to use. However, on the fourth, more than enough DNA was found. The test, which has a degree of accuracy acceptable in UK courts, proved that a man named Patrick Coyne was her biological father.\n[\n125\n]\n[\n126\n]\nIn 2018\nthe Buckskin girl\n(a body found in 1981 in\nOhio\n) was identified as Marcia King from\nArkansas\nusing DNA genealogical techniques\n[\n127\n]\nIn 2018\nJoseph James DeAngelo\nwas arrested as the main suspect for the\nGolden State Killer\nusing DNA and genealogy techniques.\n[\n128\n]\nIn 2018, William Earl Talbott II was arrested as a suspect for the 1987\nmurders of Jay Cook and Tanya Van Cuylenborg\nwith the assistance of\ngenealogical DNA testing\n. The same\ngenetic genealogist\nthat helped in this case also helped police with 18 other arrests in 2018.\n[\n129\n]\nIn 2018, with the use of Next Generation Identification System's enhanced biometric capabilities, the\nFBI\nmatched the\nfingerprint\nof a suspect named Timothy David Nelson and arrested him 20 years after the alleged\nsexual assault\n.\n[\n130\n]\nDNA evidence as evidence to prove rights of succession to British titles\n[\nedit\n]\nDNA testing has been used to establish the right of succession to British titles.\n[\n131\n]\nCases:\nBaron Moynihan\nPringle baronets\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nForensic identification\nFull genome sequencing\nGene mapping\nHarvey v.

But these earlier techniques have been replaced in forensic DNA analysis by PCR- based STR discrete- allele typing.

On GEDMatch, users are able to upload their genetic data from any direct-to-consumer company in an effort to identify relatives that have tested at companies other than their own.\nIdentifying unknown subjects through investigative genetic genealogy is done through the use of analysis of\nidentity-by-descent\n(IBD) segments of\nDNA\nthat indicate shared ancestors.\n[\n5\n]\nData available in GEDMatch, which is composed of genetic profiles from approximately 1.2 million individuals, has proven capable of identifying a third cousin or closer in over 90% of the population.\n[\n6\n]\nThis information, used in tandem with demographic identifiers like age, gender, and place of residence, is sufficient for identifying any person who has a third cousin or closer within a publicly accessible genetic genealogy database.\nLaw enforcement agencies have leveraged the access to public databases by uploading crime-scene genealogy data and inferring relatives to potential suspects.\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\nFamily tree assembly and analysis of demographic identifiers is then carried out by genetic genealogy experts, either working directly for law enforcement agencies or through one of the many US companies that have been set up to work on these cases.\nParabon Nanolabs\nis the most well known company working in this field.\n[\n10\n]\nBy January 2021 Parabon claimed to have used genetic genealogy to produce an investigative lead in over 200 cases.\n[\n11\n]\nThe\nDNA Doe Project\n, a non-profit organization, have also been instrumental in resolving unidentified remains cases, many of whom are victims of violent crimes.\n[\n12\n]\nField application\n[\nedit\n]\nThere are more uses to investigative forensic genealogy than cold cases or cases otherwise deemed \"unsolvable\" by law enforcement. Natural disasters such as floods, wildfires, earthquakes are all prime examples of scenarios where gene-matching can be utilized.\n[\n13\n]\nIn instances where the body is unidentifiable by standard means, such as facial recognition or dental records, genetic technology can be used.\n[\n14\n]\nLaw enforcement investigators have used the technique to identify nearly 40 women as the mothers of newborn infants who were found dead around the country, most of them decades ago.  In most of the cases reviewed by\nThe New York Times\n, women who were matched by DNA to a dead newborn were charged with murder. Some of the women who have been identified in these Baby Doe cases say they did not know they were pregnant until they went into labor. Some of the women who have been charged told the police their baby was stillborn. At least two women among the dozens of cases reviewed by\nThe New York Times\ntook their own lives after being approached by investigators armed with DNA evidence. Some were sentenced to decades in prison, while others got lighter sentences, often after pleading guilty to lesser charges like manslaughter. A handful of the women avoided prison time altogether. Civil rights advocates, doctors and defense lawyers say the new technique is raising questions that the courts are not yet prepared to answer.\n[\n15\n]\nA number of living doe situations have also been solved this way. There is push to provide more resources for DNA to be offered when there is a need to identify a child who has been trafficked, or an adult who was trafficked at a young age.\n[\n16\n]\nAgencies that fall under the US Department of Justice, who have jurisdiction on the case(s) and/or person(s), can utilize forensic genetic genealogical DNA analysis and searching, FGGS for short. There are specific rules they must follow in order to use the system.\n[\n17\n]\nComplications\n[\nedit\n]\nThe use of investigative genetic genealogy has been central in numerous high-profile cases, namely in the identification and ultimate arrest of Joseph DeAngelo, the\nGolden State Killer\n.\n[\n7\n]\nDespite its apparent success, the growing use of genetic genealogy databases by law enforcement agencies has not avoided serious scrutiny. A year prior to the arrest of DeAngelo, an individual was wrongly identified as a suspect in the murder of\nAngie Dodge\n, an 18-year-old woman who was the victim of a 1996 murder in Idaho Falls, Idaho. Michael Usry was the subject of a police investigation that led to a court order requiring Ancestry.com to disclose the identity of a partial match to crime scene DNA.\n[\n18\n]\nThis partial match was Usry, who was ultimately cleared as a suspect after police secured a warrant for his DNA. This DNA test proved that he was not a full match to the perpetrator.\nPrivacy implications\n[\nedit\n]\nDirect-to-consumer companies\n[\nedit\n]\nThe use of genetic genealogy databases by investigators has initiated a debate over the\nFourth Amendment\nimplications of genealogy data. The Fourth Amendment states that a warrant is required in situations that violate an individual's reasonable expectations of privacy.\n[\n19\n]\nGiven the sensitivity of information within direct-to-consumer genealogy databases, particularly concerning medical traits, behavioral tendencies, ethnic background, and familial associations, courts have asserted that they are subject to protection under the Fourth Amendment.\n[\n20\n]\n[\nexamples needed\n]\nCurrently, direct-to-consumer companies do not promise complete protection of user data.\n23andMe\n, a leading consumer genealogy company, states in its privacy policy that “23andMe will preserve and disclose any and all information to law enforcement agencies or others if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to…comply with legal or regulatory process”.\n[\n21\n]\nIn an effort to remain transparent to its consumers, 23andMe has a quarterly Transparency Report. This report identifies the number of government requests for user data in addition to the number of times data has been produced without the explicit consent of the individual(s) of interest. 23andMe claims to have never produced user data without consent.\n[\n22\n]\nThe other industry leader,\nAncestry.com\n, takes an analogous stance on the privacy of user data and similarly provides an annual transparency report.\n[\n23\n]\nThe direct-to-consumer genealogy company\nFamilyTreeDNA\nfaced a backlash following an admission that they were working secretly with the FBI. This partnership was initiated in 2018 and had the goal of solving cold cases involving murder and rape.\n[\n24\n]\nFollowing scrutiny, FamilyTreeDNA's president Bennett Greenspan apologized for a lack of transparency, stating \"I am genuinely sorry for not having handled our communications with you as we should have\".\n[\n24\n]\nPublic genetic genealogy databases\n[\nedit\n]\nPrivacy implications pertaining to public databases like GEDMatch are distinct from direct-to-consumer companies. As users voluntarily upload their genealogy profiles to GEDMatch, they forfeit their privacy to the data. The\nthird-party doctrine\n, originally established by the US Supreme Court, states that a person “has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information…voluntarily turn[ed] over to third parties”.\n[\n25\n]\nHowever, following intense media attention after the arrest of the Golden State Killer, GEDMatch changed their terms of service to require individuals to opt into use of their profiles by third parties.\n[\n26\n]\nIn effect, privacy rights were shifted back into the hands of the users.\nPotential for supplementing the FBI's CODIS System\n[\nedit\n]\nThe US government's own\nCombined DNA Index System\n(CODIS) database is composed of forensic evidence assessable to local, state, and federal law enforcement officials. This database consists of genetic profiles of approximately 18 million different people, however these are limited to DNA samples from convicted felons and arrestees.\n[\n27\n]\nData on the racial distribution of profiles suggests that 8.6% of the entire African American population is present in the database compared to only 2% of the white population.\n[\n20\n]\nOn the other hand, genetic profiles from direct-to-consumer databases and GEDMatch consist of 75% white individuals from Northern European descent.\n[\n5\n]\nThe vast overrepresentation of African American individuals within the CODIS database has rendered it relatively ineffective for solving serial murder and sexual assault cases, of which the majority of perpetrators are white. Based on data from 4,700 mass murderers, 57% of serial killers are white whereas only 29% are African American.\n[\n28\n]\nIt has been suggested that the use of investigative genetic genealogy, which relies heavily on databases like GEDMatch, would therefore help to reduce racial disparities in the current criminal justice system. However, in practice it has been found that the majority of victims identified through this technique were white.\n[\n29\n]\nInvestigative Genetic Genealogy Centers\n[\nedit\n]\nThe world's first Investigative Genetic Genealogy Center was launched at the\nRamapo College of New Jersey\nin December of 2022.

Insects may be found on\ncadavers\nor elsewhere around\ncrime scenes\nin the interest of\nforensic science\n. Forensic entomology is also used in cases of\nneglect\nand\nabuse\nof a\nproperty\n, as well as subjects of a\ntoxicology analysis\nto detect\ndrugs\nand incidents of\nfood contamination\n. Therefore, forensic entomology is divided into three subfields:\nmedico-legal/medico-criminal\nentomology,\nurban\n, and\nstored-product\n.\nThe field revolves around studying the types of insects commonly found in and on the place of interest (such as cadavers), their\nlife cycles\n, their presence in different environments, and how insect assemblages change with the progression of\ndecomposition\n(the process of \"\nsuccession\n\").\n[\n1\n]\nInsect assemblages can help approximate a body's primary location, as some insects are unique to specific areas.\n[\n2\n]\nIn medico-criminal cases, the primary goal is often to determine the\npostmortem interval\n(PMI; time since\ndeath\n) to aid in death investigations.\nInsect succession patterns are identified based on the time a species spends in each\ndevelopmental stage\nand the number of\ngenerations\nproduced since the insect's introduction to a food source.\n[\n3\n]\nBy analyzing insect development alongside environmental data such as\ntemperature\n,\nhumidity\n, and\nvapor density\n, forensic entomologists can estimate the time since death, as flying insects are attracted to a body shortly after death. This field also provides clues about\nantemortem\ntrauma and the displacement of a body after death.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\nSubfields\n[\nedit\n]\nUrban\n[\nedit\n]\nUrban forensic entomology typically concerns pest\ninfestations\nin buildings, gardens, or other urban environments, and may be the basis of\nlitigation\nbetween private parties and\nservice providers\nsuch as\nlandlords\nor\nexterminators\n.\n[\n6\n]\nFor instance, urban forensic entomology can be used to evaluate the efficiency of\npest control\ntechniques such as\npesticide\ntreatments, ascertaining the size of an infestation, and identifying the responsible party in situations involving infestations in\nrental homes\n. Urban forensic entomology can also assist in determining liability when stored goods, like grains or packaged foods, are contaminated with insects, helping to identify the infestation's origin. These techniques may be used in stored products cases where they can help to determine the chain of custody, when all points of possible infestation onset are examined to determine who is at fault.\n[\n7\n]\n[\nadditional citation(s) needed\n]\nMoreover,\nenvironmental management\nand\npublic health\ndepend heavily on urban forensic entomology; researchers can track the\ntransmission\nof disease\ncarried by insects\nby examining insect populations in urban settings. Forensic techniques can also guide\nconservation efforts\nby evaluating the environmental effects of\nurbanization\non insect populations.\nStored-product\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nHome-stored product entomology\nStored-product forensic entomology is often used in litigation over insect infestation or contamination of\ncommercially distributed foods\n, including grains, flour, and packaged meals.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n8\n]\nStored-product forensic entomologists may be asked to identify the species involved, evaluate the extent of an infestation, and pinpoint the infestation's source in a legal proceeding.\n[\n9\n]\nThey might also offer\nexpert testimony\nabout the circumstances that gave rise to the infestation and suggest safeguards to prevent similar risks in the future.\nIn general, forensic entomology of stored products adds both critical evidence to legal evaluation and contributes to overall\nfood safety\nand\nquality assurances\n; forensic entomologists work to guarantee that food products are safe for consumption by identifying insect species and tracking their presence in stored goods. Additionally, this sector contributes to the general enhancement of food business practices by researching and developing novel techniques for pest management and\nproduct preservation\n.\n[\n9\n]\nMedico-legal\n[\nedit\n]\nMedico-legal forensic entomology involves the study of arthropods found at the scene of various incidents such as\nmurder\n,\nsuicide\n,\nrape\n,\nphysical abuse\n, and the\nsmuggling\nof\ncontraband\n.\n[\n6\n]\nThis discipline provides the techniques to associate the victim(s), suspect(s), and scene together by identifying different arthropod species found in specific geographical locations.\n[\n10\n]\nForensic investigators can learn important details from insect activities, including the length of time passed since death (PMI), the presence of substances ― medicative or toxic ― in the body, and the movement or disturbance of the body following death. In murder investigations, forensic entomologists analyze the species of eggs which appear on the cadaver, their location on the body, and their development stage to determine the PMI and the location of death. The presence of specific insect species, which may be\nendemic\n(occurring only in certain places) or a well-defined\nphenology\n(active only at a certain season, or time of day). In association with other evidence, these can provide crucial links to times and locations where the criminal acts have occurred.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\nEntomology can also aid when determining the time of an injury. One determining factor might be the observed species' preference of alimentation; when blowfly eggs laid on a hatch into the first larval\ninstar\n(life stage), they require a liquid protein meal.\n[\n13\n]\nDue to their minute size and fragility blowflies are unable to break through human skin themselves to attain this nutrition.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nTherefore, the female typically\noviposits\nnear a pre-existing wound or natural\norifices\nto provide an accessible meal to her brood, such as\nblood\n,\nmucous\n, or other\nbody fluids\n.\nAnother area covered by medico-legal forensic entomology is the relatively new field of\nentomotoxicology\n. This particular branch involves the testing of entomological\nspecimens\nfound at a scene for different drugs that may have possibly played a role in the death of the victim. The analytical perspective behind these methods relies upon the fact that the presence of drugs within the cadaver specifically affects the growth and\nmorphology\nof the insects ingesting those toxins from the corpse.\n[\n14\n]\nDue to these alterations, the presence of drugs can potentially lead to an erroneous PMI when basing it on the abnormal physical development of insects who have fed on them.\n[\n15\n]\nMyiasis\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMyiasis\nMyiasis, the infestation of living vertebrate animals with certain species of\ndipteran\nlarvae (ex: blowfly\nmaggots\n), is a phenomenon that may be noted in cases of abandonment or neglect.\n[\n13\n]\nThis condition occurs when flies colonize a living human or animal, feeding on the organism's accessible living tissues, ingesting food or bodily fluids.\n[\n13\n]\nIn a forensic context, myasis can be confusing, as it may indicate the time of neglect or injury rather than PMI if the remains were colonized when alive. This highlights the importance of careful interpretation of all evidence in forensic investigation.\n[\n16\n]\n[\n13\n]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nHistorically, several accounts of applications have been for, and experimentation with, forensic entomology. Along with an initial case report in\nChina\nfrom the\n13th century\n, the primitive observation and correlation between arthropods and forensic contexts has been documented in Germany and France. This observation was conducted during a mass\nexhumation\nin the late 1880s by Hofmann and Reinhard.\n[\n17\n]\nHowever, only in the last 30 years has forensic entomology been systematically explored as a feasible source for evidence in\ncriminal investigations\n. Through documented experiments and focus on arthropods and death, the works of\nSung Tzu\n,\nFrancesco Redi\n,\nBergeret d'Arbois\n,\nJean Pierre Mégnin\nand the physiologist\nHermann Reinhard\nform the foundations for today's modern forensic entomology.\nOver time, the study of forensic entomology evolved from an esoteric science reserved only for entomologists and forensic scientists. Early twentieth-century popular scientific literature began to pique a broader interest in\nentomology\n. The very popular ten-volume book series, Alfred Brehem's\nThierleben\n(Life of Animals, 1876–1879) expounded on many\nzoological\ntopics, including the biology of\narthropods\n. The accessible writing style of French entomologist\nJean-Henri Fabre\nwas also instrumental to the popularization of entomology. His collection of writings\nSouvenirs Entomologique\n, written during the last half of the 19th century, is especially useful because of the meticulous attention to detail to the observed insects' behaviors and life cycles.\n[\n17\n]\n[\n18\n]\nSong Ci\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nSong Ci\nSong Ci (\nsometimes called\nSung Tzu) was a\nSong dynasty\n-era (960–1279) judicial intendant and\npolymath\nwriter who lived in China from 1188 to 1251 AD. He wrote a book titled\nWashing Away of Wrongs\n/\nCollected Cases of Injustice Rectified\nin 1247 AD, which was intended as a\nhandbook\nfor\ncriminal investigators\nand\ncoroners\nso that they may assess a crime scene effectively; it subsequently became the earliest recorded account of someone using forensic entomology for judicial means. Here he depicts several cases in which he took notes on\nhow a person died\nand determining the\nprobable cause\n. He also explains in detail how to examine a corpse before and after burial. The level of detail in his explanations of all his cases laid down the fundamentals for modern forensic entomologists.\n[\n19\n]\n[\n20\n]\nIn one murder case dated 1235, a villager was\nstabbed\nto death and authorities determined that his wounds were inflicted by a\nsickle\n, a tool used for cutting rice at\nharvest time\n, a fact which led them to suspect a fellow\npeasant\nworker was involved. The local\nmagistrate\nhad the villagers assemble in the\ntown square\n, where they would temporarily relinquish their sickles.\n[\n21\n]\nWithin minutes, a swarm of\nblow flies\ngathered around one sickle and no others, attracted to traces of\nblood\nunseen by the naked eye.\n[\n21\n]\nIt became apparent to all that the owner of that sickle was the\nculprit\n, the latter pleading for mercy as authorities detained him.\n[\n21\n]\nFrancesco Redi\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nFrancesco Redi\nIn 1668, Italian physician Francesco Redi disproved the theory of\nspontaneous generation\n, which was the accepted theory of Redi's day; it claimed that maggots developed\nspontaneously\n(without any visible cause) from rotting meat. In an experiment, Redi used samples of rotting meat that were either fully exposed to the\nair\n, partially exposed to the air, or isolated from the air. Redi showed that both fully and partially exposed rotting meat bore maggots whereas rotting meat not exposed to air did not develop maggots; this discovery completely changed how people viewed the process of\ndecomposition\nand prompted further investigations into insect life cycles and entomology in general.\n[\n22\n]\nBergeret d'Arbois\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nLouis François Etienne Bergeret\nDr. Louis François Etienne Bergeret (1814–1893) was a French physician and was the first to apply forensic entomology to a case.\n[\ncontradictory\n]\nIn a case report published in 1855, he stated a general life cycle for insects and made many assumptions about their mating habits. Nevertheless, these assumptions led him to the first application of forensic entomology in an estimation of post-mortem interval (PMI). His report used forensic entomology as a tool to prove his hypothesis on how and when the person had died.\n[\n17\n]\n[\nclarification needed\n]\nHermann Reinhard\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nHermann Reinhard\nThe first systematic study in forensic entomology was conducted in 1881 by German doctor Hermann Reinhard. He exhumed many bodies and demonstrated that the development of many different insect species could be tied to buried bodies. Reinhard conducted his first study in\nEastern Germany\nand collected many\nPhorid flies\nthere. He concluded that the development of some, but not all species, of insects were associated directly with decaying flesh since there were 15-year-old beetles who had little direct contact with the bodies. Reinhard's works and studies were used extensively in further forensic entomology studies.\n[\nclarification needed\n]\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nJean Pierre Mégnin\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nJean Pierre Mégnin\nFrench\nveterinarian\nand entomologist Jean Pierre Mégnin (1828–1905) published many articles and books on various subjects, including the books\nFaune des Tombeaux\nand\nLa Faune des Cadavres\n(\"\nThe Fauna of\nTombs\n(1887)\" and \"\nThe Fauna of Cadavers\n(1894)\", respectively), which are considered to be among the most important forensic entomology books in history.\n[\n23\n]\nMégnin made many great discoveries that helped shed new light on many of the general characteristics of decaying flora and fauna; the second book in particular contained revolutionary work on the theory of \"predictable waves\", the process of insect succession on corpses: he asserted that exposed corpses were subject to eight successional waves, whereas buried corpses were only subject to two waves. In one case, he was able to estimate how long an infant had been dead for (PMI) by counting the numbers of live and dead\nmites\nevery 15 days, and comparing the data with his initial count.\n[\n17\n]\nHis study of the larval and adult forms of insect families found in cadavers sparked the interest of future entomologists and encouraged more research in the link between arthropods and the deceased, and thereby helped to establish the scientific discipline of forensic entomology. It was after the publication of Mégnin's work that the studies of forensic science and entomology became an established part of Western\npopular culture\n, which in turn inspired other Western scientists to continue and expand upon his research.\n[\n17\n]\n: 5\nPostmortem interval estimation\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nPost-mortem interval\nThis section may\nrequire\ncleanup\nto meet Wikipedia's\nquality standards\n. The specific problem is:\nRemove irrelevant and redundant information.\nPlease help\nimprove this section\nif you can.\n(\nMay 2025\n)\n(\nLearn how and when to remove this message\n)\nA crucial component of forensic entomology is the calculation of the postmortem interval (PMI), which mostly depends on the observation of the insect activity on a corpse.\n[\n24\n]\nUsing the life stages of insects discovered on or near a body, forensic entomologists can reasonably determine how long it has been since a person died.\nThe pace of insect colonization and development is influenced by a number of variables, including as temperature, humidity, the presence of other living things and others.\n[\n24\n]\nThe accumulated degree hour (ADH) approach, which determines the total amount of heat energy generated by a body since death, is one of the models and methodologies used by forensic entomologists to estimate the PMI.\n[\n24\n]\nEven through PMI estimation based on insect evidence is typically accurate, it is crucial to take into account additional elements including body position, ambient circumstances and insect behavior that may have an impact on insect activity.\nFactors\n[\nedit\n]\nMoisture levels\n[\nedit\n]\nBoth the decomposition and insect activity on a corpse are significantly influenced by humidity. Elevated humidity can hasten the decomposition process by fostering microbial proliferation, which facilitates the breakdown of tissues. Additionally the odors and gases produced by this microbial activity draw insects to the body. These smells are particularly attractive to insects like blowflies and flesh flies, which may quickly populate a body in humid conditions.\n[\n25\n]\nLow humidity, on the other hand, can impede the breakdown process. Mummification rather that breakdown may result from the body losing moisture more quickly in arid settings. Given that many insects need damp atmosphere to survive, this may discourage their activity. Nonetheless, some insects, like dermestid beetles, can survive in dry environments and can still be found on a body.\n[\n26\n]\n[\n27\n]\nThe existence of standing water next to a body can also affect the activity of insects. Aquatic insects, such as water beetles and some fly species, may be drawn to bodies near water sources. These insects can colonize the body and hasten its decomposition. Furthermore, because different insect species have distinct preference for habitats, the presence of water might influence the kinds of insects that inhabits the body.\nAll things considered, the rate and pattern of a corpse's decomposition and insect colonization are greatly influenced by its humidity. To estimate the postmortem period and reconstruct the circumstances around a death, forensic entomologists can benefit from an understanding of how humidity levels affect decomposition.\n[\n28\n]\nSubmerged corpses\n[\nedit\n]\nM. Lee Goff, a noted and well respected\nforensic entomologist\n, was assigned to a case involving the discovery of a decomposing body found on a boat half a mile from shore. Upon collection of the maggot mass, only one insect,\nChrysomya megacephala\n, was discovered. He concluded that the water barrier accounted for the scarcity of other flies. He also noted that flies will not attempt to trek across large bodies of water unless there is a substantially influential attractant.\nIn addition, the amount of time a maggot mass has been exposed to salt water can affect its development. From the cases Goff observed he found that if subjected for more than 30 minutes, there was a 24‑hour developmental delay. Not many more studies have been conducted and thus a specific amount of delay time is difficult to estimate.\n[\n29\n]\nThe main focus of a study accomplished by Payne and King\n[\n30\n]\nusing fetal pigs, was the insect succession regarding carcass decomposition in an aquatic setting. Their results concluded that in the early floating stages of the cadaver, eggs were laid by blowflies. Moreover, by the bloating stage, most of the exposed flesh was absent and maggots migrated from the body. Many of the latter were present below the water line and fed on the carcass; with only their\nSpiracle (arthropods)\nprotruding the surface.\nSun exposure\n[\nedit\n]\n\"Because insects are cold-blooded animals, their rate of development is more or less dependent on ambient temperature.\"\n[\n31\n]\nBodies exposed to large amounts of sunlight will heat up, giving the insects a warmer area to develop, reducing their development time.\nAn experiment conducted by Bernard Greenberg and John Charles Kunich with the use of rabbit carcasses to study accumulation of degree days found that with temperature ranging in the mid 70s to high 80s the amount of developmental time for maggots was significantly reduced.\n[\n32\n]\nIn contrast, bodies found in shaded areas will be cooler, and insects will require longer growth periods. In addition, if temperatures reach extreme levels of cold, insects instinctively know to prolong their development time in order to hatch into a more accepting and viable climate in order to increase the chance of survival and reproduction.\nFurthermore, insect activity and colonization patterns can also be influenced by the length and intensity of solar exposure. Because the increasing temperature speeds up their development, insects are more likely to be active and colonize a body more quickly in places exposed to direct and extended sunlight. In comparison to shaded locations, this may result in a quicker succession of insect life and disintegration stages. On the other hand, because of the lower temperatures, shaded areas might have slower rates of insect activity and decomposition, which would delay the processes of insect colonization and decomposition.\n[\n33\n]\nAir exposure\n[\nedit\n]\nAir exposure can have a significant impact on insects and the determination of postmortem interval (PMI). Hanged bodies can be expected to show their own quantity and variety of flies. Also, the amount of time flies will stay on a hanged body will vary in comparison to one found on the ground. A hanged body is more exposed to air and thus will dry out faster, leaving less food source for the maggots.\nThe presence and behavior of insects on hanging bodies can vary. As the body begins to decompose, a compilation of fluids will leak to the ground. This area is where most of the expected fauna can be found. Also, it is more likely that rove beetles and other non-flying insects will be found here instead of directly on the body. Fly maggots, initially deposited on the body, may also be found below.\n[\n29\n]\nGeography\n[\nedit\n]\nAccording to\nJean Pierre Mégnin\n's book\nLa Faune des Cadavres\nthere are eight distinct faunal successions attracted to a corpse. While most\nbeetles\nand\nflies\nof forensic importance can be found worldwide, a portion of them are limited to a specific range of habitats. It is forensically important to know the geographical distribution of these insects in order to determine information such as post mortem interval or whether a body has been moved from its original place of death.\nCalliphoridae\nis arguably the most important family concerning forensic entomology given that they are the first to arrive on the corpse. The family can be found worldwide.\nChrysomya rufifaces\n, the hairy maggot\nblow fly\n, is a forensically important member of the family Calliphoridae and is widespread, however it is not prevalent in the Southern\nCalifornia\n,\nArizona\n,\nNew Mexico\n,\nLouisiana\n,\nFlorida\n, or\nIllinois\nregions.\n[\n34\n]\nFlesh flies\nfall under the family Sacrophagidae and generally arrive at a corpse following Calliphoridae. Unlike Calliphoridae, however, members of this family are able to fly in heavy rain. This key advantage enables them to occasionally reach a body before Calliphoridae, affecting the maggot mass that will be discovered. Flesh flies are globally distributed including habitats in the United States, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.\n[\n35\n]\nBeetles are representative of the order\nColeoptera\nwhich accounts for the largest of the insect orders. Beetles are very adaptive and can be found in almost all environments with the exception of\nAntarctica\nand high mountainous regions. The most diverse beetle fauna can be found in the tropics. In addition, beetles are less submissive to temperatures. Thus, if a carcass has been found in cold temperatures, the beetle will be prevalent over Calliphoridae.\nWeather\n[\nedit\n]\nVarious weather conditions in a given amount of time cause certain pests to invade human households. This is because the insects are in search of food, water, and shelter.\nDamp weather causes reproduction and growth enhancement in many insect types, especially when coupled with warm temperatures. Most pests concerned at this time are\nants\n,\nspiders\n,\ncrickets\n,\ncockroaches\n,\nladybugs\n,\nyellowjackets\n,\nhornets\n,\nmice\n, and\nrats\n.\nWhen conditions are dry, the deprivation of moisture outside drives many pests inside searching for water. While the rainy weather increases the numbers of insects, this dry weather causes pest invasions to increase. The pests most commonly known during dry conditions are\nscorpions\n, ants,\npillbugs\n,\nmillipedes\n, crickets, and spiders. Extreme drought does kill many populations of insects, but also drives surviving insects to invade more often.\nCold temperatures outside will cause invasions beginning in the late summer months and early fall.\nBox elder bugs\n,\ncluster flies\n, ladybugs, and\nsilverfish\nare noticed some of the most common insects to seek the warm indoors.\n[\n36\n]\nIn general, insects are poikilothermic animals; thus meaning their level of activity is substantially depended upon their surrounding environmental conditions. An increase in the temperature will result in an accelerated metabolism of the insect; hence resulting in an increased activity.\n[\n37\n]\nArthropods in decomposition\n[\nedit\n]\nThe activities of insects and other arthropods within a carcass are essential to decomposition; the breakdown of organic materials including human remains. Chemicals emitted during decomposition attract\nnecrophagous\ninsects, those that feed on dead creatures. These insects hasten the decomposition process by aiding in the breakdown of bodily\ntissues\n.\n[\n38\n]\nMany species have been recorded on cadavers, and they are covered below.\nInsect succession\n[\nedit\n]\nLife cycle of a fly\nInsect succession, as utilized in forensic entomology, refers to the orderly progression of insect colonization and decomposition processes on a corpse over time.\n[\n24\n]\nTheir life cycle typically consists of four stages : eggs, larval, pupal, and adult. Each stage has unique eating behavior that changes as the organism breaks down. In forensic investigations, the presence and developmental phases of insects can provide important data for understanding environmental circumstances, body movement, and postmortem interval (PMI) estimation. In forensic entomology, insects play a crucial role as indicators, helping to identify key components of a death investigation due to their distinct ecological responsibilities and varied geographic distribution. Given that different insect species inhabit a body in a certain order, understanding insect succession is essential for predicting the postmortem interval (PMI). Typically, insect succession occurs in the following stages:\nFresh stage: Marked by the arrival of necrophagous insects attracted to the body by chemicals, such as flesh flies and blowflies. These insects deposit their eggs (oviposit) on or near to the body, and the decaying tissues are the maggot's food source.\n[\n39\n]\n[\n38\n]\nBloated stage: The body starts to swell as a result of gas buildup during the breakdown process. During this phase, insects such as\ncheese skipper\nand\ncoffin flies\nbecome more common.\n[\n39\n]\n[\n38\n]\nDecay stage: In this stage, the insect community changes as the body goes through a more advanced state of decomposition. Predatory insects and mites increase in number, as do beetles, such as dermestid beetles and rove beetles.\n[\n39\n]\n[\n38\n]\nDry stage: The body dries up and the skeletal remains become visible during the last phases of decomposition. Scavenger insects and animals may be present on the remains, along with insects like ham beetles and hide beetles.\n[\n39\n]\n[\n38\n]\nFresh stage\nBloat stage\nDecay stage\nDry stage\nDecompositional stages of a\npig\ncarcass\nInvertebrate types\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section\nneeds additional citations for\nverification\n.\nPlease help\nimprove this article\nby\nadding citations to reliable sources\nin this section.

A great presence of scorpionflies may indicate shorter postmortem intervals.\n[\n40\n]\n[\n41\n]\nFlies\n[\nedit\n]\nFlies\nfrom the order\nDiptera\nare very often found at a crime scene, because they are attracted to the\nodoriferous\nchemicals released by decomposing bodies, known as\nvolatile organic compounds\n(VOCs).\n[\n42\n]\nA dead body is a perfect ovipositional environment for flies, as the developing maggots will have an abundant and ready food source. Different types of flies can be found on dead bodies, the most significant of which are:\nBlowflies on a fresh\ncape porcupine\nBlow flies (\nCalliphoridae\n): Flies in this family are often metallic in appearance and between 10 and 14 mm in length.\n[\n43\n]\nIn addition to the name blow-fly, some members of this family are known as\nblue bottle fly\n,\ncluster flies\n,\ngreenbottles\n, or\nblack blowfly\n. A characteristic of the blow-fly is its 3-segmented\nantennae\n. Hatching from an egg to the first larval stage takes from eight hours to one day.\nLarvae\nhave three stages of development (called\ninstars\n); each stage is separated by a\nmolting\nevent, where they shed their old skin to grow.\n[\n44\n]\nThe larvae's ideal habitat in regard to\npupation\nare locations providing access to loose, damp soil and litter, with favorable temperatures.\n[\n45\n]\nWorldwide, there are 1100 known species of blowflies, with 228 species in the\nNeotropics\n, and a large number of species in\nAfrica\nand\nSouthern Europe\n. The most common area to find Calliphoridae species are in the countries of\nIndia\n,\nJapan\n,\nCentral America\n, and in the\nsouthern United States\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThese flies' forensic importance is due to them being among the first insect to come in contact with\ncarrion\nbecause they have the ability to smell death from up to ten miles (16 km) away.\n[\n46\n]\nSome prominent species of Calliphoridae are\nCalliphora vomitoria\nand\nCalliphora vicina\n.\nFlesh fly on decomposing flesh\nFlesh flies (\nSarcophagidae\n): Most flesh flies breed in carrion,\nfeces\n,\ngarbage\n, and other decaying material, but a few species lay their eggs in the\nopen wounds\nof mammals, hence their\ncommon name\n. Characteristics of the flesh-fly is its 3-segmented\nantennae\n. Most\nholarctic\nSarcophagidae vary in size from 4 to 18 mm in length (tropical species can be larger) with black and gray longitudinal stripes on the\nthorax\nand checkering on the\nabdomen\n. Flesh-flies are viviparous, frequently giving birth to live young on dead humans and other animals at any stage of decomposition, from newly dead through to bloated or decaying (though the latter is more common).\nSarcophaga barbata\nare specifically useful since they deposit maggots directly onto the decomposing body, their larger, visible size, and difference in activity during different stages. Their main limitation, however, is due to lack of information surrounding their geographic distribution and taxonomic features.\nTimeline of postmortem changes (\nstages of death\n), including house fly eggs, larvae and pupae\nHouse flies (\nMuscidae\n): One of the most common of all\nflies\nfound in homes, and indeed one of the most widely distributed insects; it is often considered a\npest\nthat can carry serious diseases. The adults are 6–9 mm long. Their\nthorax\nis gray, with four longitudinal dark lines on the back. The underside of their abdomen is yellow, and their whole body is covered with hair. Each female fly can lay up to 500 eggs in several batches of about 75 to 150\neggs\n. Genus\nHydrotaea\nare of particular forensic importance.\nCheese flies (\nPiophilidae\n): Most are scavengers of animal products and fungi. The best-known member of the family is\nPiophila casei\n; it is a small fly, about four mm (1/6 inch) long, found worldwide, and is sometimes called the cheese skipper for its leaping ability. The adult fly's body is black, blue-black, or bronze, with some yellow on the head, antennae, and legs. The wings are faintly\niridescent\nand lie flat upon the fly's\nabdomen\nwhen at rest. At four mm (1/6 inch) long, the fly is one-third to one-half as long as the common\nhousefly\n. Its larvae infests\ncured meats\n,\nsmoked fish\n,\ncheeses\n, and decaying animals. Forensic entomology uses the presence of\nPiophila casei\nlarvae to help estimate the date of death for human remains, as they do not take up residence in a corpse until three to six months after death.\nCoffin flies (\nPhoridae\n): aka Humpbacked flies. The larvae feed on decaying bodies, thus they are important in buried bodies. Some species can burrow to a depth of 50 cm over 4 days.\nLesser corpse flies (\nSphaeroceridae\n)\nLesser house flies (\nFanniidae\n)\nBlack scavenger flies (\nSepsidae\n)\nSun flies (\nHeleomyzidae\n)\nSoldier flies (\nStratiomyidae\n): These flies have potential for use in forensic entomology. The larvae of some species (\nHermetia illucens\n, the black soldier fly) are common\nscavengers\nin compost heaps, are found in association with carrion, can be destructive pests in\nbeehives\n, and are used in\nmanure\nmanagement (for both\nhouse fly\ncontrol and reduction in manure volume). The larvae range in size from 1/8 to 3/4 of an inch (3 to 19 millimeters). The adult fly is a\nmimic\n, very close in size, color, and appearance to the\norgan pipe mud dauber\nwasp and its relatives.\nNon-biting midges (\nChironomidae\n): These flies have a complex life cycle. While adults are terrestrial and phytophagous,\nlarvae are aquatic\nand detritivorous. Immature instars have been used as forensic markers in several cases where submerged corpses were found.\n[\n47\n]\nBeetles\n[\nedit\n]\nBeetles (Order\nColeoptera\n) are generally found in later stages of decomposition.\n[\n48\n]\nThey play a role in breaking down the remaining soft tissue and are important in the final stages of decomposition. In drier conditions, the beetles can be replaced by moth flies (\nPsychodidae\n).\n[\nclarification needed\n]\nTheir life cycle normally consists of four stages : eggs, larval, pupal, and adult. Each stage has unique eating behavior that changes as the organism breaks down. In forensic investigations, the existence and developmental phases of insects can yield important data for understanding environmental circumstances, body movement, and PMI estimation. In forensic entomology, insects play a crucial function as indicators, helping to identify vital components of a death investigation due to their distinct ecological responsibilities and varied geographic distribution. Different types of beetles can be found on dead bodies the most significant include:\nRove Beetle\nRove beetles (\nStaphylinidae\n): Elongate beetles with small\nelytra\n(wing covers) and large jaws. Rove beetles have a four-stage life cycle; egg, larvae, pupa and adult.\n[\n49\n]\nCreophilus\nspecies are common predators of carrion, and since they are large, are a very visible component of the fauna of corpses. Some adult Staphylinidae are early visitors to a corpse, feeding on larvae of all species of fly, including the later predatory fly larvae. They lay their eggs in the corpse, and the emerging larvae are also predators. Some species have a long development time in the egg, and are common only during the later stages of decomposition. Staphylinids can also tear open the\npupal\ncases of flies, to sustain themselves at a corpse for long periods.\nHister beetles (\nHisteridae\n): Adult histerids are usually shiny beetles (black or metallic-green) which have an introverted head. The carrion-feeding species only become active at night when they enter the maggot-infested part of the corpse to capture and devour their maggot prey. During daylight they hide under the corpse unless it is sufficiently decayed to enable them to hide inside it. They have fast larval development with only two larval stages. Among the first beetles to arrive at a corpse are Histeridae of the genus\nSaprinus\n.\nSaprinus\nadults feed on both the larvae and pupae of\nblowflies\n, although some have a preference for fresh pupae. The adults lay their eggs in the corpse, inhabiting it in the later stages of decay.\nCarrion beetles (\nSilphidae\n): Adult Silphidae have an average size of about 12 mm. They are also referred to as burying beetles because they dig and bury small carcasses underground.\n[\n50\n]\nBoth parents tend to their young and exhibit communal breeding. The male carrion beetle's job in care is to provide protection for the breed and carcass from competitors.\nNecrodes littoralis\nis a type of carrion beetle in the Silphidae family that prefers to inhabit bodies that are outdoors and in the later stages of decomposition. Modeling the activity and behaviors of carrion beetles like\nN. littoralis\nand other carrion beetles that inhabit bodies earlier in death is a helpful tool to map time of death.\n[\n51\n]\n[\n52\n]\nHam beetles (\nCleridae\n)\nCarcass beetles (\nTrogidae\n)\nSkin/hide beetles (\nDermestidae\n): Hide beetles are important in the final stages of decomposition of a carcass. The adults and larvae feed on the dried skin,\ntendons\n, and\ncartilage\nleft by fly larvae. Hide beetles are the only beetle with the enzymes necessary for breaking down\nkeratin\n, a protein component of hair and nails.\nScarab beetles (\nScarabaeidae\n): Scarab beetles may be any one of around 30,000 beetle species worldwide that are compact, heavy-bodied and oval in shape. The flattened plates, which each antenna terminates, are fitted together to form a club. The outer edges of the front legs may also be toothed or scalloped. Scarab beetles range from 0.2 to 4.8 in (5.1 to 121.9 mm) in length. These species are known for being one of the heaviest insect species.\n[\nrelevant?\n]\n[\n53\n]\nSap beetles (\nNitidulidae\n)\nMites\n[\nedit\n]\nMany\nmites\n(\nAcari\n, which are\narachnids\n) feed on corpses, with\nMacrocheles\nmites common in the early stages of decomposition, while\nTyroglyphidae\nand\nOribatid\nmites such as\nRostrozetes\nfeed on dry skin in the later stages of decomposition.\nNicrophorus\nbeetles (which are Silphids) often carry the mite\nPoecilochirus\nupon their bodies; these feed on fly eggs.\n[\n54\n]\nIf they arrive at the corpse before any fly eggs hatch into maggots, the first eggs are eaten and maggot development is delayed. This may lead to incorrect PMI estimates.\nNicrophorus\nbeetles find the\nammonia\nexcretions of blowfly maggots toxic, and the\nPoecilochirus\nmites, by keeping the maggot population low, allow\nNicrophorus\nto occupy and dominate the corpse.\nMoths\n[\nedit\n]\nMoths\n(order\nLepidoptera\n) such as\nclothes-moths\n(\nTineidae\n) – are closely related to\nbutterflies\n. Most species of moth are\nnocturnal\n, but there are\ncrepuscular\nand\ndiurnal\nspecies. During their larval stages, clothes moths tend to feed on mammalian\nhair\n.\n[\n55\n]\nThey are amongst the final animals contributing to the decomposition of a corpse. This said, adult moths lay their legs on a carcass\nsubsequently\nto fly larvae having had their presence on it.\n[\nclarification needed\n]\nWasps, ants, and bees\n[\nedit\n]\nWasps, ants, and bees (order\nHymenoptera\n) are not necessarily necrophagous. While some feed on the body, some are also predatory, eating the insects feeding on the body.\nParasitoids\nsuch as\nparasitoid wasps\nlay their eggs within the eggs or pupae of other insects, oftentimes only on those of specific\nhost species\n, and eventually kills their host.\n[\n13\n]\nA relevant type of parasitoid are the\nPteromalidae\n, which oviposit only upon the pupae of\nmuscoid\nflies. The wasp larvae will feed on the fly developing within the puparium, eventually killing it.\n[\n13\n]\nBees and wasps have been seen feeding on bodies during the early stages.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThis may cause problems for murder cases in which larval flies are used to estimate the PMI since eggs and larvae on the body may have been consumed prior to the arrival on scene of investigators.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nModern techniques\n[\nedit\n]\nMany new techniques have been developed and are used in order to more accurately\ngather evidence\n, or reevaluate old information.\n[\n56\n]\nThe use of these newly developed techniques and evaluations have become relevant in litigation and appeals. Forensic entomology not only uses arthropod biology, but it pulls from other sciences, introducing fields like chemistry and genetics, exploiting their inherent synergy through the\nuse of DNA in forensic entomology\n. In order to improve the precision and dependability of insect-based evidence analysis, forensic entomologists nowadays use a variety of cutting-edge technologies, such as stable isotope analysis and DNA analysis. These methods have broadened the field of forensic entomology by making it possible to identify insect species more precisely, pinpoint their geographic origins, and draw important conclusions about the circumstances surrounding a death. Some of the most important contemporary forensic entomology techniques are examined in this section along with how they are applied to criminal investigations.\nScanning electron microscopy\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nScanning electron microscope\nFly larvae and fly eggs are used to aid in the determination of a PMI. In order for the data to be useful the larvae and eggs must be identified down to a species level to get an accurate estimate for the PMI. There are many techniques currently being developed to differentiate between the various species of forensically important insects. A study in 2007 demonstrates a technique that can use\nscanning electron microscopy\n(SEM) to identify key morphological features of eggs and maggots.\n[\n57\n]\nSome of the morphological differences that can help identify the different species are the presence/absence of anastomosis, the presence/absence of anterior and posterior spiracles,\n[\n58\n]\nthe cephalopharyngeal skeleton as well as the shape and length of the median area.\nThe SEM method provides an array of morphological features for use in identifying fly eggs; however, this method does have some disadvantages. The main disadvantage is that it requires expensive equipment and can take time to identify the species from which the egg originated, so it may not be useful in a field study or to quickly identify a particular egg.\n[\n59\n]\nThe SEM method is effective provided there is ample time and the proper equipment and the particular fly eggs are plentiful. The ability to use these morphological differences gives forensic entomologists a powerful tool that can help with estimating a post mortem interval, along with other relevant information, such as whether the body has been disturbed post mortem.\nPotassium permanganate staining\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nStaining (biology)\nWhen scanning electron microscopy is not available, a faster, lower cost technique is\npotassium permanganate\nstaining. The collected eggs are rinsed with a\nnormal saline\nsolution and placed in a glass petri dish. The eggs are soaked in a 1% potassium permanganate solution for one minute and then dehydrated and mounted onto a slide for observation.\n[\n59\n]\nThese slides can be used with any\nlight microscope\nwith a calibrated eyepiece to compare various morphological features. The most important and useful features for identifying eggs are the size, length, and width of the plastron, as well as the morphology of the plastron in the area around the micropyle.\n[\n59\n]\nThe various measurements and observations when compared to standards for forensically important species are used to determine the species of the egg.\nDNA analysis\n[\nedit\n]\nModern forensic entomology now relies heavily on DNA analysis as a fundamental tool for accurately identifying insect species and gaining important insights into their interactions with human remains. Using this method, DNA is extracted from insect specimens discovered at crime scenes and compared to databases containing known DNA sequences. Forensic entomologists can verify species identification, identify the existence of particular species linked to decomposition, and even establish a connection between insects and particular geographical areas through the examination of insect DNA.\n[\n60\n]\nThe identification of insect stomach contents is one of the main uses of DNA analysis in forensic entomology. Investigators can ascertain the insect's most recent meal by sequencing the DNA contained in the gut of maggots or other insect larvae discovered on a body. When determining the postmortem interval (PMI) or locating possible sources of contamination or infection, this information might be extremely important.\n[\n24\n]\nThe study of insect dispersal patterns and colonization behaviour has also been transformed by DNA research. Researchers can deduce patterns of travel and colonization by examining the genetic variety of insect populations. This can provide important insights into the origin of insect specimens found at crime scenes or the transportation of a body.\n[\n61\n]\nIn general, DNA analysis has improved forensic entomology's accuracy and dependability significantly, allowing investigators to obtain previously unobtainable specific information from insect evidence.\nMitochondrial DNA\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMitochondrial DNA\nIn 2001, a method was devised by Jeffrey Wells and Felix Sperling to use\nmitochondrial DNA\nto differentiate between different species of the subfamily Chrysomyinae. This is particularly useful when working to determine the identity of specimens that do not have\ndistinctive morphological characteristics\nat certain life stages.\n[\n61\n]\nGene expression studies\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nGene expression\nAlthough physical characteristics and sizes at various\ninstars\nhave been used to estimate fly age, a more recent study has been conducted to determine the age of an egg based on the expression of particular genes. This is particularly useful in determining developmental stages that are not evidenced by change in size; such as the egg or pupa and where only a general time interval can be estimated based on the duration of the particular developmental stage. This is done by breaking the stages down into smaller units separated by predictable changed in\ngene expression\n.\n[\n62\n]\nThree genes were measured in an experiment with\nDrosophila melanogaster\n: bicoid (bcd), slalom (sll), and chitin synthase (cs). These three genes were used because they are likely to be in varied levels during different times of the egg development process. These genes all share a linear relationship in regards to age of the egg; that is, the older the egg is the more of the particular gene is expressed.\n[\n62\n]\nHowever, all of the genes are expressed in varying amounts. Different genes on different loci would need to be selected for another fly species. The genes expressions are mapped in a control sample to formulate a developmental chart of the gene expression at certain time intervals. This chart can then be compared to the measured values of gene expression to accurately predict the age of an egg to within two hours with a high\nconfidence level\n.\n[\n62\n]\nEven though this technique can be used to estimate the age of an egg, the feasibility and legal acceptance of this must be considered for it to be a widely utilized forensic technique.\n[\n62\n]\nOne benefit of this would be that it is like other DNA-based techniques so most labs would be equipped to conduct similar experiments without requiring new capital investment. This style of age determination is in the process of being used to more accurately find the age of the instars and pupa; however, it is much more complicated, as there are more genes being expressed during these stages.\n[\n62\n]\nThe hope is that with this and other similar techniques a more accurate PMI can be obtained.\nMock crime scenes\n[\nedit\n]\nA valuable tool that is becoming very common in the training of forensic entomologists is the use of mock crime scenes using pig carcasses. The pig carcass represents a human body and can be used to illustrate various environmental effects on both arthropod succession and the estimate of the post mortem interval.\n[\n63\n]\nPigs are the most frequently utilised model in an attempt to gather data regarding forensic experimental analysis. The latter is highly proportionate to human nature due to our overlapping characteristics with the mentioned species. These interrelated components include: subcutaneous fat stores, skin thickness, range of adult body mass, hair covering, and omnivorous diets.\n[\n64\n]\nStable isotope analysis\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nStable isotope analysis\nA contemporary method that is being used more and more in forensic entomology to shed light on the ecology and life cycle of insects connected to human remains is stable isotope analysis. Using this technique, the stable isotopic composition of elements found in insect tissues, including carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen, is measured. The environment in which the insect developed, including its diet and place of origin, is reflected in these isotopes.\n[\n65\n]\nStable isotope analysis provides information on the travel of the body or the insect itself, and can be used in forensic investigations to assist identify the geographic origin of insects found on a body. Furthermore, features of the insect's diet, such as whether it consumed organic matter or human remains, can be inferred by stable isotope analysis. This information can be vital to comprehending the insect's function in the decomposition process.\n[\n66\n]\nWhen using traditional methods to identify insect species or estimate age, this methodology has proven quite helpful. Stable isotope analysis contributes to more accurate and thorough forensic studies by improving the precision and depth of forensic entomological investigations by offering a distinct chemical signature that represents the insect's surroundings.\nInsect activity case study\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section may contain information\nnot\nimportant or relevant\nto the article's subject.\nPlease help\nimprove this section\n.\n(\nMay 2025\n)\n(\nLearn how and when to remove this message\n)\nA preliminary investigation of insect colonization and succession on remains in\nNew Zealand\nrevealed the following results on decay and insect colonization.\n[\n67\n]\nOpen field habitat\n[\nedit\n]\nThis environment had a daily average maximum temperature of 19.4 °C (66.9 °F) and a daily minimum temperature of 11.1 °C (52.0 °F). The average rainfall for the first 3 weeks in this environment was 3.0 mm/day. Around days 17–45, the body began to start active decay. During this stage, the insect successions started with\nCalliphora\nstygia\n, which lasted until day 27. The larvae of\nChrysomya rufifacies\nwere present between the day 13 and day 47.\nHydrotaea\nrostrata\n, larvae of\nLucilia sericata\n, family\nPsychodidae\n, and\nSylvicola\nwere found to be present relatively late in the body's decay.\nCoastal sand-dune habitat\n[\nedit\n]\nThis environment had an average daily maximum temperature of 21.4 °C (70.5 °F) and minimum of 13.5 °C (56.3 °F). The daily average rainfall was recorded as 1.4 mm/day for the first 3 weeks. The post-decay time interval, beginning at day six after death and ending around day 15 after death, is greatly reduced from the average post-decay time, due to the high average temperature of this environment. Insects obtained late in the post-active stage include the\nCalliphora quadrimaculata\n, adult Sphaeroceridae,\nPsychodidae\nand\nPiophilidae\n(no larvae from this last family were obtained in recovery).\nNative bush habitat\n[\nedit\n]\nThis environment had recorded daily average maximum and minimum temperatures were 18.0 and 13.0 °C (64.4 and 55.4 °F), respectively. The average rainfall in this habitat was recorded at 0.4 mm/day. After the bloat stage, which lasted until day seven after death, post-active decay began around day 14. In this habitat, the\nH. rostrata\n, adult\nPhoridae\n, Sylvicola larvae and adult were the predominant species remaining on the body during the pre-\nskeletonization\nstages.\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nForensic entomology and the law\nInsect indicators of abuse or neglect\nNotes\n[\nedit\n]\n^\n\"Forensic Entomology\"\n.\nExplore Forensics\n.

FE is directed at filling the gap between clinical judgment and epidemiologic data for determinations of causality in civil\nlawsuits\nand criminal prosecution and defense.\n[\n1\n]\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\nForensic epidemiologists formulate\nevidence-based\nprobabilistic conclusions about the type and quantity of causal association between an antecedent harmful exposure and an injury or disease outcome in both populations and individuals. The conclusions resulting from an FE analysis can support legal decision-making regarding guilt or innocence in criminal actions, and provide an evidentiary support for findings of\ncausal association\nin civil actions.\nApplications of forensic epidemiologic principles are found in a wide variety of types of civil litigation, including cases of medical negligence, toxic or mass tort, pharmaceutical adverse events, medical device and consumer product failures, traffic crash-related injury and death, person identification and life expectancy.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThe term Forensic Epidemiology was first associated with the investigation of\nbioterrorism\nin 1999, and coined by Dr. Ken Alibek, the former chief deputy of the Soviet bioweapons program\n[\ncitation needed\n]\n. The scope of FE at that time was confined to the investigation of epidemics that were potentially man-made. After the US\nAnthrax\nattacks of 2001 the\nCDC\ndefined forensic epidemiology as a means of investigating possible acts of bioterrorism.\nAt the present time FE is more widely known and described as the systematic application of epidemiology to disputed issues of causation that are decided in (primarily) civil, but also criminal courts. The use of epidemiologic data and analysis as a basis for assessing general causation in US courts, particularly in toxic tort cases, has been described for more than 30 years, beginning with the investigation of the alleged relationship between exposure to the\nSwine Flu\nvaccine in 1976 and subsequent cases of\nGuillain–Barré syndrome\n.\n[\n5\n]\nMore recently FE has also been described as an evidence-based method of quantifying the probability of specific causation in individuals. The approach is particularly helpful when a clinical differential diagnosis approach to causation is disputed. Examples covering a wide variety of applications of FE are listed below under Examples of Investigative Questions Addressed by Forensic Epidemiologists.\nMethods and principles\n[\nedit\n]\nComparative risk ratio\n[\nedit\n]\nThe metric of a case-specific FE analysis of cause is the comparative risk ratio (CRR).  The CRR is a unique metric to FE; it allows for the comparison of probabilities applicable to the investigated circumstances of an individual injury or disease.  Because a CRR is based on the unique circumstances surrounding the injury or disease of an individual, it may or may not be derived from a population-based\nrelative risk\n(RR) or\nodds ratio\n(OR). An example of an RR analysis that could be used as a CRR  is as follows: for an unbelted driver who was seriously injured in a traffic crash, an important causal question might be what role the failure to use a seat belt played in causing his injury. A relevant RR analysis would consist of the examination of the frequency of serious injury in 1000 randomly selected unbelted drivers exposed to a 20 mph frontal collision versus the frequency of serious injury in 1000 randomly selected restrained drivers exposed to the same collision severity and type. If the frequency of serious injury in the group exposed to the presumptive hazard (failure to use a seat belt) was 0.15 and the frequency in the unexposed (belted) group was 0.05, then the CRR would be the same thing as the RR of 0.15/0.05. The RR design of the analysis dictates that the populations that the numerator and denominator of the CRR  are substantially similar in all respects, with the exception of the exposure to the investigated hazard, which was the failure to use a seat belt in the example.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nIn some instances encountered in a legal setting, however, the numerator and denominator risk must be derived from dissimilar populations in order to fit the circumstances of an investigated injury or disease. In such a case the CRR cannot be derived from either an RR or OR. An example of such a situation occurs when the numerator is a per event risk, and the denominator is a per-time risk (also known as a cumulative risk). An example of this type of analysis would be the investigation of a pulmonary embolism (PE) that occurred a week after a patient sustained a lower extremity fracture in a traffic crash. Such complications often result from blood clots forming in the legs and then traveling to the lungs. If the patient had a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities prior to the crash, then a CRR might consist of the comparison between the risk of a PE following a lower extremity fracture (a per event rate) and  the 1-week risk of PE in a patient with DVT (a time-dependent probability).\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nAnother example of a CRR based on dissimilar populations is when there are only a limited number of potential causes to be compared. An example is the investigation of the cause of an adverse reaction in a person who took two different drugs at the same time, both of which could have caused the reaction (and which, for the example, do not interact with each other). In such a situation, the CRR applicable to the unique circumstances experienced by the individual could be estimated by comparing the adverse reaction rate for the two drugs.\nAttributable proportion under the exposed\n[\nedit\n]\nThe attributable proportion under the exposed (AP\ne\n) is an indication of the proportion of patients who were exposed to the potential cause and got sick because of this exposure. It can only be used if the RR >1 and can be calculated by [(RR-1)/RR X 100%]. When the CRR is based on an RR, these formulae also apply to the CRR. The result of the analysis, given as an RR, CRR, or AP\ne\n, meets the legal standard of what is “\nmore likely true than not\n,”  when the RR or CRR is >2.0 (with a 95% confidence interval lower boundary of >1.0), or the AP\ne\nis >50%. The AP\ne\nis also known as the \"\nProbability of Causation\n(PC)\" a term that is defined in the US Code of Federal Regulations (\nFederal Register / Vol. 67, No. 85 / Thursday, May 2, 2002 / Rules and Regulations p. 22297\n) and elsewhere.\nCausal methodology\n[\nedit\n]\nAnalysis of causation, particularly for injury or other conditions with a relatively short latency period between exposure and outcome, is accomplished using a 3-step approach, as follows:\n[\n6\n]\nPlausibility: This first step addresses whether it is biologically\npossible\nfor the injury event to have caused the condition (a.k.a. general causation), and follows a special application of the viewpoints set forth by Hill (see below). A finding of plausibility is unrelated to the\nfrequency\nof the injury, because even if the injury occurs in only 1 in 100 or fewer cases of exposure to the event, it is still\nplausibly\ncaused by the event. Plausibility is a relatively low hurdle to clear in a causal analysis, and is largely satisfied by the lack of evidence of\nimplausibility\nof the relationship. Plausibility is often, but not necessarily, established with epidemiologic data or information.\nTemporality: This second step examines the clinical and other evidence of the timing between the onset of the symptoms of injury and the injury event, and must be satisfied to assess specific causation. First, it must be established that the sequence of the injury and the event is appropriate; the symptoms cannot be identically present prior to the event. Further, the onset of the symptoms of injury cannot be either too latent or insufficiently latent, depending on the nature of the exposure and outcome.\nLack of a more probable alternative explanation: This final step examines the probability of the injury condition occurring at the same point in time in the individual, given what is known about the individual from the review of medical records and other evidence, but in the absence of the injury event (a.k.a. differential diagnosis). First, evidence of competing injury events must be evaluated, and compared for risk (often via analysis of epidemiologic data). Then, the likelihood of the condition occurring spontaneously must be assessed, given the known history of the individual.\nUnited States case law on injury causation methodology\n[\nedit\n]\nThe 3-step methodology was challenged in United States District Court for the District of Colorado in\nEtherton v Auto-Owners Insurance Company\n.\n[1]\nThe defendant challenged, among other things, the reliability and fit of the methods described by the expert. After an extensive examination and discussion of the 3-step process used by the expert, the court found that the methodology appropriately fit the specific facts of the case, and that a population-based (epidemiologic) approach was an appropriate part of the causal methodology. The court denied the defendant's motion to strike the expert's testimony in the order, which was entered on 3/31/14.\nThe Defendant appealed the ruling from the District Court, and in July 2016, the Tenth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the 3-step causal methodology as generally accepted and well established for assessing injury causation, under the\nDaubert standard\n.  See\nEtherton v. Auto-Owners Insurance Company\n, No. 14-1164 (10th Cir, 7/19/16)\n[2]\nArchived\n2016-08-03 at the\nWayback Machine\n.\nHill viewpoints\n[\nedit\n]\nPlausibility\nof an investigated association can be assessed in an FE investigation, in part, via application of the\nHill criteria\n, named for a 1965 publication by Sir Austin Bradford-Hill, in which he described nine \"viewpoints\" by which an association described in an epidemiologic study could be assessed for causality.\n[\n7\n]\nHill declined to call his viewpoints \"criteria\" lest they be considered a checklist for assessing causation. The term \"Hill criteria\" is used widely in the literature, however, and for convenience is used in the present discussion. Of the nine criteria, there are seven that have utility for assessing the plausibility of an investigated specific causal relationship, as follows:\nCoherence: A causal conclusion should not contradict present substantive knowledge. It should \"make sense\" given current knowledge\nAnalogy: The results of a previously described causal relationship may be translatable to the circumstances of a current investigation\nConsistency: The repeated observation of the investigated relationship in different circumstances or across a number of studies lends strength to a causal inference\nSpecificity: The degree to which the exposure is associated with a particular outcome\nBiological plausibility: The extent to which the observed association can be explained by known scientific principles\nExperiment: In some cases there may be evidence from randomized experiments (\ni.e.\n, drug trials)\nDose response: The probability, frequency, or severity of the outcome increases with increased amount of exposure\nThe triangular relationship between exposure, outcome, and confounder. When investigating whether there is a causal relationship between an exposure and outcome of interest, the influence of extraneous variables needs to be taken into account. A confounder is defined as a concurrent cause of the outcome under investigation that is related to, but not a consequence of, the exposure of interest.\nSubsequent authors have added the feature of\nChallenge/ Dechallenge/ Rechallenge\nfor circumstances when the exposure is repeated over time and there is the ability to observe the associated outcome response, as might occur with an adverse reaction to a medication. Additional considerations when assessing an association are the potential impact of\nconfounding\nand\nbias\nin the data, which can obscure a true relationship. Confounding refers to a situation in which an association between an exposure and outcome is all or partly the result of a factor that affects the outcome but is unaffected by the exposure. Bias refers to a form of error that may threaten the validity of a study by producing results that are systematically different from the true results. Two main categories of bias in epidemiologic studies are\nselection bias\n, which occurs when study subjects are selected as a result of another unmeasured variable that is associated with both the exposure and outcome of interest; and\ninformation bias\n, which is systematic error in the assessment of a variable. While useful when assessing a previously unexplored association, there is no combination or minimal number of these criteria that must be met in order to conclude that a plausible relationship exists between a known exposure and an observed outcome.\nIn many FE investigations there is no need for a causal plausibility analysis if a general causal relationship is well established. In large part, plausibility of a relationship is entertained once implausibility has been rejected. The two remaining Hill criteria are temporality  and strength of association. While both criteria have utility in assessing specific causation, temporality is the feature of an association that must be present, at least with regard to sequence (\ni.e.\n, the exposure must precede the outcome), in order to consider a relationship causal. Temporal proximity can also be useful in some specific causation evaluations, as the closer the investigated exposure and the outcome are in time the less opportunity there is for an intervening cause to act. Another feature of temporality that may have a role in a specific causation evaluation is latency. An outcome may occur too soon or too long after an exposure to be considered causally related. As an example, some food borne illnesses must incubate for hours or days after ingestion, and thus an illness that begins directly following a meal, and which is later found to be caused by a food borne microorganism that requires >12 h incubation, was not caused by the investigated meal, even if an investigation were to reveal the microorganism in the ingested food. Strength of association is the criterion that is used in general causation to assess the impact of the exposure on the population, and is often quantified in terms of RR. In a specific causation evaluation the strength of the association between the exposure and the outcome is quantified by the CRR, as described above.\nA contingency table, also called a crosstabulation, of possible test outcomes, and the associated equations for evaluating test accuracy\nTest accuracy\n[\nedit\n]\nTest accuracy investigation is a standard practice in clinical epidemiology. In this setting, a diagnostic test is scrutinized to determine by various measures how often a test result is correct. In FE the same principles are used to evaluate the accuracy of proposed tests leading to conclusions that are central to fact finder determinations of guilt or innocence in criminal investigations, and of causality in civil matters. The utility of a test is highly dependent on its accuracy, which is determined by a measure of how often a positive or negative test result truly represents the actual status that is being tested. For any test or criterion there are typically four possible results: (1) a true positive (TP), in which the test correctly identifies tested subjects with the condition of interest; (2) a true negative (TN), in which the test correctly identifies test subjects who do not have the condition of interest; (3) a false positive (FP), in which the test is positive even though condition is not present, and; (4) a false negative (FN) in which the test is negative even though the condition is present. Fig. 3.19 is a contingency table illustrating the relationships between test results and condition presence, as well as the following test accuracy parameters:\nSensitivity\n(the rate at which the test is positive when the condition is present) TP/(TP + FN)\nSpecificity\n(the rate at which the test is negative when the condition is absent) TN/(TN + FP)\nPositive predictive value\n(the rate at which the condition is present when the test is positive) TP/(TP + FP)\nNegative predictive value\n(the rate at which the condition is absent when the test is negative) TN/(TN + FN)\nBayesian reasoning\n[\nedit\n]\nProbability is used to characterize the degree of belief in the truth of an assertion. The basis for such a belief can be a physical system that produces outcomes at a rate that is uniform over time, such as a gaming device like a roulette wheel or a die. With such a system, the observer does not influence the outcome; a fair six-sided die that is rolled enough times will land on any one of its sides 1/6th of the time. An assertion of a probability based in a physical system is easily tested with sufficient randomized experimentation. Conversely, the basis for a high degree of belief in an asserted claim may be a personally held perspective that cannot be tested. This does not mean that the assertion is any less true than one that can be tested. As an example, one might truthfully assert that “if I eat a banana there is a high probability that it will make me nauseous” based upon experience unknown to anyone but one's self. It is difficult to test such assertions, which are evaluated through collateral evidence of plausibility and analogy, often based on similar personal experience. In forensic settings, assertions of belief are often characterized as probabilities, that is,\nwhat is most likely\n, for a given set of facts. For circumstances in which a variety of conditions exist that may modify or “ condition”  the probability of a particular outcome or scenario, a method of quantifying the relationship between the modifying conditions and the probability of the outcome employs\nBayesian reasoning\n, named for\nBayes’ Theorem\nor Law upon which the approach is based. Most simply stated, Bayes’ Law allows for a more precise quantification of the uncertainty in a given probability. As applied in a forensic setting, Bayes’ Law tells us what we want to know given what we do know. Although Bayes’  Law is known in forensic sciences primarily for its application to DNA evidence, a number of authors have described the use of Bayesian reasoning for other applications in forensic medicine, including identification and age estimation.\nPost-test probability\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\npost-test probability\nis a highly useful Bayesian equation that allows for the calculation of the probability that a condition is present when the test is positive, conditioned by the pretest prevalence of the condition of interest. This equation is given in box to the right:\nPost-test probability equation\nThe equation results in a positive predictive value for a given pre-event or pretest prevalence. In a circumstance in which the pretest prevalence is considered “indifferent” the prevalence and (1-prevalence) values cancel out, and the calculation is a simplified to a positive predictive value.\nExamples of investigative questions\n[\nedit\n]\nWhat is likelihood that the asbestos exposure that Mr X experienced during his employment at company Z caused his lung cancer?\nHow likely is it that the DNA found on the forensic scene belongs to Mr X?

Different methods are used to collect this data but all identify the ratios of different diatom species present in samples and compare those samples with the location of a crime scene.\n[\n1\n]\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\nDiatom testing is a key method to distinguish between drowning or disposal of a body in water after death.\nUse of diatoms\n[\nedit\n]\nMicroscopic view of diatoms\nDiatoms are diverse microscopic single-celled algae with silica cell walls, called\nfrustules\n, that are abundant in freshwater and saltwater ecosystems. There are around 12,000 described species of diatoms that are identifiable based on the unique morphology of their frustules.\n[\n4\n]\nFor many species, there are also known habitat preferences, such as pH or salinity. Which species are present and their relative abundances varies depending on their environment and time of year. Additionally, when diatoms die, the frustules sink and are left behind as part of the water sediment providing a natural time series of diatom assemblages over seasonal and yearly changes. Diatom monitoring programs track the species composition and relative abundances of in an environment, called a diatom profile, of different bodies of water. These profiles can then be used to compare with the species presence and abundances collected from crime scenes or victims.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n6\n]\nBenefits of diatoms\n[\nedit\n]\nThe reason diatoms are a common tool to match water environments is because of the variability of their populations are relatively predictable and constant, they can be identified by using a\nlight microscope\n, and their silica cell walls allow for preservation and extraction from collected samples.\n[\n2\n]\nDiatoms can also be collected as evidence from items such as clothing or shoes to inform investigations.\n[\n7\n]\nIf a diatom profile for a water body is not available to compare with collected evidence, different types of diatoms found in a crime scene sample or victim can identify properties of the ecosystem it came from. For example, a higher ratio of periphytic diatoms (i.e., those that are attached to a substrate), the higher the vegetation concentration, and the shallower the water.\n[\n6\n]\nDiatoms can also be used to distinguish between drowning or disposal of a body in water after death.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n7\n]\nDisadvantages of diatoms\n[\nedit\n]\nDiatoms do not inhabit treated water sources, which limits the situations that diatoms can be used.\n[\n1\n]\nDiatom profiles can only explain when or where evidence was found in some situations, and not the time of death if there is no body fluid sample available to be collected. If a body is placed in freshwater\npost mortem\nthen diatoms cannot be used to evaluate the time of death. Without the inhalation of water and some circulation present in the victim, the diatoms will not be able to enter the alveolar system and bloodstream making it difficult to extract a reliable sample. Another issue with the use of diatoms is because frustules do not break down easily, the presence of diatoms may not only be on a victim or suspect through their relation to a crime scene, which affects the reliability of the results collected from a scene. Different species can also be differentialy preserved, which could affect the results in a criminal investigation.\n[\n7\n]\n[\n3\n]\nFinally, collecting and analyzing diatoms as evidence is time-consuming and effort intensive.\n[\n7\n]\nDiatom testing\n[\nedit\n]\nMaterials taken from victims, suspects, or the crime scene can be tested to match locations of where the samples derived.\nIn order to use diatom testing there are some guidelines that scientists must follow. To get a more accurate result there must be at least 20 diatoms in a 100 microliter sample. When dealing with testing on a human body, having five complete diatoms from more than two different organs will also give a positive diagnosis.\n[\n2\n]\nSamples are taken from bone marrow, lung, spleen, liver, kidney, brain tissue, or from the area where the crime was discovered or occurred.\n[\n8\n]\nThere are a number of different extraction methods, the most commonly used are \"acid digestion\" methods, which use a strong acid, such as nitric or sulfuric acid, to dissolve all organic materials, leaving behind the diatom frustules to be analyzed.\n[\n7\n]\nWhen diatom testing on an organic sample scientists use\nphase contrast microscopy\n. While observing the diatoms are tallied and organized based on their different species. The ratio of specific specimen of diatoms in the water will have a similar ratio to the sample that is taken from the site where the diatoms were transferred. Scientists use this to match materials and people to specific locations at a crime scene. A diatom database (started in 2006) can be used as the \"fingerprint system\" for diatoms: a computer identifies diatoms to species based on shape and color characteristics. However, as of 2012, the database was not complete and was not used in courts.\n[\n8\n]\nTime of death estimation\n[\nedit\n]\nWhen using diatom testing, scientists observe the amount of diatoms present on the organism and may be able to estimate a generalized time of death. For example, if there are fewer than 20 different species of colonizing diatoms, then the organism's death could have been within the previous 7 to 12 days, but, if there are more than 50 different colonies of diatoms then it is determined that death possibly occurred several weeks ago. Certain diatoms narrow the time frame to more exact dates. For instance, late colonizers, such as\nAnkistrodesmus\nalgae, may not start to colonize on an organism until 30 days after its death.\n[\n2\n]\nLegal application\n[\nedit\n]\nAs of 2012, a small percentage of forensic limnology is used as evidence in courts. The presence of diatoms in air, food, drink, and close contact is not variable enough to be supportive evidence in determining locations of events. Even so, an investigation requires the use of forensic limnology in order to estimate time of death, location of drowning, and the determining of suspect. If the results of forensic limnology are not used in prosecution, the results are used to understand the crime.\n[\n8\n]\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\na\nb\nCoyle, Heather Miller; Carll Ladd; Timothy Palmbach; Henry C.

In 1537, aged just 22, Vesalius performed public dissections to show how the human body worked, and became professor of medicine at\nPadua University\n. He insisted that his medical students should perform dissections.\n[\n6\n]\nHis work \"\nDe Humani Corporis Fabrica\n\" was\ngroundbreaking\nin the history of\nmedical publishing\nand is considered to be a major step in the development of\nscientific medicine\n.\n[\n7\n]\nPaul Zacchias\nwas also one of the earliest figures of medical jurisprudence, with association with the\nPapal States\nand\nCatholic Church\n.\n[\n8\n]\nZacchias was the personal physician to\nPope Innocentius X\nand\nPope Alexander VII\n, as well as legal adviser to the\nRota Romana\n.\n[\n9\n]\nHis most well known book,\nQuaestiones medico-legales\n(1621–1651) established\nlegal medicine\nas a topic of study.\n[\n10\n]\nZacchias work contains\nsuperstitious\nviews on\nmagic\n,\nwitches\n, and\ndemons\nwhich were widely held at the time.\n[\n11\n]\nMedical jurisprudence had a chair founded at the\nUniversity of Edinburgh\nin 1807, first occupied by\nAndrew Duncan, the younger\n. It was imposed on the university by the administration of\nCharles James Fox\n, and in particular\nHenry Erskine\nworking with\nAndrew Duncan, the elder\n.\n[\n12\n]\nIn the 19th century two new tools appear:\nForensic psychiatry\n(to determine the\nmental health\nand blameworthiness of a suspect), and\nforensic toxicology\n(giving evidence in cases as intentional poisonings and\ndrug use\n).\n[\n13\n]\nIn the United Kingdom, the Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine was established as a Faculty of the\nRoyal College of Physicians\nin 2006 to develop and maintain the highest possible standards of\ncompetence\nand professional\nintegrity\nin forensic and legal medicine. The specialty covers professionals working in three related disciplines: forensic medical practitioners (forensic physicians, forensic pathologists, sexual assault examiners, and child\nphysical\nand\nsexual assault\nexaminers); medico-legal advisers; and medically qualified\ncoroners\n.\n[\n14\n]\nScope\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section\ndoes not\ncite\nany\nsources\n.\nPlease help\nimprove this section\nby\nadding citations to reliable sources\n.

On the other hand, a physician may be required to act in the interest of third parties if his patient is a danger to others.

This includes\nspermatophyte\npollen, as well as spores (fungi,\nbryophytes\n, and ferns),\ndinoflagellates\n, and various other organic microorganisms – both living and fossilized.\n[\n5\n]\nThere are a variety of ways in which the study of these microscopic, walled particles can be applied to criminal forensics.\nIn areas such as New Zealand, where the demand for this field is high, forensic palynology has been used as evidence in many different case types that range anywhere from non-violent to extremely violent crimes.\n[\n6\n]\nPollen has been used to trace activity at mass graves in\nBosnia\n,\n[\n7\n]\npinpoint the scene of a crime,\n[\n6\n]\nand catch a burglar who brushed against a\nHypericum\nbush during a crime.\n[\n8\n]\nBecause pollen has distinct morphology and is relatively indestructible, it is likely to adhere to a variety of surfaces often without notice and has even become a part of ongoing research into forensic bullet coatings.\n[\n9\n]\nPresent status\n[\nedit\n]\nForensic palynology is an evolving forensic science application mostly utilized in countries such as\nNew Zealand\n,\nAustralia\n, and the\nUnited Kingdom\n.\n[\n1\n]\nIt is relatively \"small, disparate, and fragmented\" compared to the other approaches, thus, there is no thorough guide to achieve the best practice in forensic palynology.\n[\n10\n]\nMoreover, there is a limit in forensic palynologists as most skilled palynologists do not enter the forensic palynology field.\n[\n11\n]\nAs becoming a Forensic Palynologist requires rigorous training and education, one must attain a PhD with sufficient background in studies such as forensic science, botany, ecology, geography, and climatology.\n[\n12\n]\nMost importantly they must receive training in the field of quaternary science.\n[\n12\n]\nRecently however, there has been expansive research into areas that have yet to well documented, such as the study that did research on the effects that an arid climate had on pollen analytics that took place in southeast Spain.\n[\n13\n]\nThis study not only expanded the use of forensic palynology into new parts of the world that have not yet been introduced to this science, but also collected results that outline a proper method for pollen spectra collecting that is effective in arid conditions.\n[\n13\n]\nAnother recent study did research in Bolivia to study the pollen assemblage in high altitude soils, this study also created a forensic database for uses in non-seasonal soil.\n[\n14\n]\nThis database creation is allowing forensic palynology to be used in a more broad area now, as data for both high altitude pollen assemblage and non-seasonal soil data has been collected.\n[\n14\n]\nAnother recent advancement in forensic palynology is the massive expansion of the largest pollen database on the internet, PalDat. The University of Vienna and AGES worked to integrate over 2000 datasets consisting of detailed methods for pollen analysis including the use of high resolution light microscopy micrographs of hydrated pollen, and polarity ratios to determine the shape and aperture position of a pollen grain.\n[\n15\n]\nDuties\n[\nedit\n]\nIn terms of criminal investigation, forensic palynologist services are requested from cases such as forgery, rape, homicide, genocide, terrorism, drug dealing, assault, and robbery.\n[\n1\n]\nIt usually consist of a single individual who works with the polynomial case. Of course, the palynologist could still consult other professionals. Furthermore, the palynologist should be given significant information as there is only one person handling the analysis of the samples. Important duties to note is that they ensure that all paperwork is dated, signed, filed and archived in order to maintain good records. Forensic Palynologists usually visit the crime scene to survey the vegetation. For example, identify plants and their characteristics and qualities ( size, vigor...) and obtain plant samples to allow for analysis like ground sampling. Geography analysis including a survey of the topography, altitude, climate, and geology of the area is also required, as all of these factors influence the assemblage and composition of palynomorphs.\n[\n16\n]\nScrubbing, scraping, washing is essential for retrieval of palynomorphs from various materials. And utilize other methods like police photographers, cartographers, and botanists. It is vital for the Forensic Palynologist to visit the crime scene before the Crime Science Investigators (CSI) or Scenes of crime Officers (SOCOs) to avoid disturbance of environmental evidence and contamination.\n[\n10\n]\nAdvantages\n[\nedit\n]\nPollen and similar spores are generally less than 50\nmicrons\nacross, resulting in their easy and unnoticeable transportation.\nPollen grains\nhave a variety of shapes, sizes, colors, structures, and numbers\nidentification keys\nexist as a reference. Large-scale collections of pollen specimens that reside in museums and university\nherbaria\nalso serve as a resource for forensic palynologists to identify and classify the samples they collect. There are also many online databases that consist of thousands of records and identification methods for palynomorphs that are accessible worldwide.\n[\n15\n]\nA sample of pollen from a crime scene can help to identify a specific plant species that may have had contact with a victim, or point to evidence that does not ecologically belong in the area. A pollen assemblage is a sample of pollen with a variety of plant species represented. Identifying those species and their relative frequency can point to a specific area or time of year. This could aid in the determination of whether the scene where the pollen was found was the primary scene or secondary scene. Pollen is made in great numbers, by a large variety of plants, and it is designed to be\ndispersed\n(either via wind, insect, or another method) throughout the immediate environment. Pollen can also be found in soil, clothing, hair, drugs, stomach contents, ropes, and rock which are places where it would be difficult for the suspect to remove because of pollen's adhesion properties.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n5\n]\nIn some cases, where the pollen of a plant is absent, fungi and fungal spores may be able to detect a plant's presence at the site.\n[\n17\n]\nThere have been cases where the presence of rarely reported fungi and fungal spores have helped identify information in forensic cases.\n[\n17\n]\nPollen has been found inside counterfeit pharmaceuticals that have been transported across the world, the presence of the pollen can be used to trace these illegal drugs back to their manufacturing region and even factory.\n[\n18\n]\nDisadvantages\n[\nedit\n]\nOne of the main disadvantages in this field is the lack of trained specialists.\n[\n5\n]\nAs of 2008, there are no academic centers or training facilities for the use of pollen in forensics in the U.S.\n[\n19\n]\n[\n5\n]\nThis is crucial because of the expertise required to identify palynomorphs and to apply the data to geolocation information.\n[\n20\n]\nMany things could go wrong and invalidate any samples collected, especially if the personnel handling them is not experienced. On the subject of experience, contamination is another major problem that can invalidate the use of a sample as evidence; therefore, it is important that samples are collected early on with collection sites identified depending on the case.\n[\n21\n]\nLimited access to international databases can also prove to be an issue when it comes time for the analyst to identify pollen evidence to a specific family or genus of plants.\n[\n22\n]\nCurrently, a\ndatabase\nfrom Austria called PalDat exists but there are no known databases to exist in North America.\n[\n6\n]\nHowever, PalDat is internationally accessible and data from around the world has been published.\n[\n15\n]\nAnother disadvantage is in the form of the lack of history and therefore acceptance in the forensic setting and the court of law. Forensic palynology is not used in many countries and the application and methodologies have not been reviewed extensively in the court as this methodology has only been around for 50 years and only in some countries.\n[\n23\n]\nThis means that forensic palynology evidence is rarely submitted due to lack of history in the courts, and lack of application in most countries.\nMethods\n[\nedit\n]\nSample collection\n[\nedit\n]\nBecause pollen can be easily picked up by anyone, it is important that pollen samples are collected as soon as possible to prevent contamination from outside sources.\n[\n19\n]\nSamples then need to be prepared and placed on slides in order to fully be safe from contamination.\n[\n19\n]\nThe process of preparing the samples and identifying them is time-consuming. When collecting a sample, it should be paired with site surveys and photos of the scene to provide context for later uses.\n[\n1\n]\nFor example, if the pollen evidence is used in court, then the additional context would be useful.\nSample collection methods will vary depending on the case investigation and on the collector.\n[\n1\n]\nDue to the lack of palynologists in the forensic field, other forensic scientists that are present may have to collect the samples.\n[\n1\n]\nThis raises issues in terms of the quality of the sample, since collection sites for the sample should be determined depending on the case.\n[\n1\n]\nDiscussion with the investigation team is necessary in order to establish the best sampling method.\n[\n1\n]\nWhen collection sites have been determined, samples can be retrieved with clean instruments and placed into tightly sealed, sterile containers.\n[\n1\n]\nExamples are \"sterile zip-lock plastic bags, or screw-top plastic (in preference to glass) containers.\"\n[\n1\n]\nAfter each sample, instruments should be thoroughly cleaned or replaced to prevent contamination.\n[\n1\n]\nIn cases, where collection is by hand, gloves should be used and replaced after each sample.\n[\n1\n]\nSamples should be labeled and sample history documentation should be maintained to keep track of the people who have had access to the sample.\n[\n1\n]\nAnalysis\n[\nedit\n]\nAnalyzing the samples, once the palynomorphs have been extracted, will allow for identification, which can then be used in a forensic case to relate a person or object to a crime scene, or even to determine whether the scene at which the pollen was found was the primary or the secondary scene.\n[\n19\n]\nSamples are chemically processed with a mix of acids, sodium hydroxide, acetic anhydride with water washes in between.\n[\n17\n]\nThey are then neutralized, and the extracts are stained and mounted onto slides for microscopic examination.\n[\n17\n]\nThis helps in identification with the help of available reference collections to make comparisons on the pollen's characteristics.\n[\n19\n]\nThe scanning electron microscope (SEM) has been used traditionally since the 1970s for primary identification of palynomorphs, but is very time-consuming, tedious, and not ideal for routine analysis.\n[\n5\n]\nCompared to the SEM, semi-automated pollen grain imaging techniques such as Transmitted Light Microscopy (TLM), Widefield fluorescent method, and Structured illumination (Apotome) were found to have a higher speed and accuracy when it came to the identification of pollen spores.\n[\n5\n]\nDNA Barcoding is another method used to differentiate between pollen grains by comparing their DNA sequences.\n[\n5\n]\nA pollen grain of 10 micrometers in length is required.\n[\n5\n]\nOnce the sample is collected and prepared, genetic markers are placed, then the DNA is isolated, and finally the DNA is sequenced, usually through high throughout sequencing (HTS).\n[\n5\n]\nHTS is faster and less expensive than traditional methods for DNA barcoding.\n[\n5\n]\nCase examples\n[\nedit\n]\nAustria, 1959\n[\nedit\n]\nOne of the earliest document cases in which pollen plays a key role took place in Austria. A man went missing, and was presumed murdered, but no body was found. The authorities had arrested a suspect, who had motive for the murder, but did not have a body or confession, and the case stalled. A search of the suspect's belongings yielded a pair of muddy boots. The mud was sampled and given to Wilhelm Klaus, at the\nUniversity of Vienna\n's Paleobotany Department, for analysis. Dr. Klaus found modern pollen from a variety of species, including spruce, willow, and alder. He also found fossilized hickory pollen grains, from a species long extinct. There was only one area of the\nDanube River\nValley that hosted those living plants, and had\nMiocene\n-aged rock deposits that would contain the fossilized species. When the suspect was presented with this information, he willingly confessed and lead authorities to the sites of both the murder and the body, both of which were inside the region indicated by Dr. Klaus.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n24\n]\nUnited States, 1970\n[\nedit\n]\nThe first cases that involved forensic palynology in the United States was in 1970, where Honeybee pollination studies were issued. During this time honey pollen analysis began growing as the\nUnited States Department of Agriculture\n(USDA) ensured beekeepers a higher world market price for their honey, subject to the condition that the honey was produced on USA soil. Thus, honey samples were sent for pollen analysis to confirm whether the honey was produced in the USA. Generally, most of the cases during this time involved lawsuits concerning beekeepers. For example, a Michigan beekeeper was suspected of importing beehives from the southeastern USA that weren't inspected for mites. This led to the USDA inspecting honey samples where it was concluded that they were imported from the Southeastern region of USA. Due to that the honey contained floral types common to the Southeastern region and not found in Michigan.\n[\n25\n]\nUnited Kingdom, 1993\n[\nedit\n]\nAn example concerning Forensic Palynology in the United Kingdom, which took place during 1993, handled by Patricia Wiltshire.\n[\n26\n]\nIt involved a murder case in which the body was laid on soil that preserved pollen. Wiltshire then found traces of walnut pollen in the soil and suspect's shoes, however, the walnut pollen found was unusual as there was no walnut site nearby. However, It was later discovered that a walnut tree was cut down thirty years before and the walnut pollen remained. the pollen was then analyzed and linked to the suspect in the crime scene. Thus, the walnut pollen provided a significant role solving the case.\n[\n27\n]\nNew Zealand, 2005\n[\nedit\n]\nAfter a home invasion, two burglars brushed past a\nHypericum\nbush outside of the house. One of the burglars was brought in as a suspect, but all evidence was circumstantial, and the man did not confess. Analysis of his clothes revealed the\nHypericum\npollen. The presence of pollen is ubiquitous, but in this case, the pollen was clumped onto the clothing (rather than dusted) and did not seem to be simply the result of air dispersal. It was ultimately concluded that \"the clothes had so much\nHypericum\npollen on them that they had to have been in direct and intimate contact with a flowering bush.\"\n[\n8\n]\nUnited States, 2015\n[\nedit\n]\nA modern application of forensic palynology occurred in 2015, in the city of Boston, Massachusetts. A body of a young female child was discovered by law enforcement in the Boston Harbour, but no identifying features remained as the body was in the late stages of decomposition. Investigators submitted samples taken from the clothes of the victim, a blanket found with the body, as well as a small amount of recovered hair to the\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection\ndirectorate laboratory in Houston, Texas, for pollen analysis. The report from the submitted samples provided investigators with information they could use to identify the unknown victim.\n[\n28\n]\nThe pollen assemblage created from the submitted samples indicated the victim was in the north-eastern United States before her death. The individual taxa of plant species observed in the assemblage also indicated that the victim lived in, or spent much of her time in, a developed, urban environment. The assemblage also captured pollen of the Lebanese cedar tree (\nCedrus libani\n), native to the\nEastern Mediterranean\nregion of Europe. The species of cedar observed in the assemblage was thought by investigators to most likely be from an ornamental piece in a park or other conservation area. This is when the investigators discovered individuals of the Lebanese cedar tree in the\nArnold Arboretum\n, a public park that is a part of\nHarvard University\n.\n[\n28\n]\nInvestigators then asked around the neighborhoods surrounding the arboretum, and a tip led them to a resident who, after questioning, admitted that her boyfriend at the time had abused the child, which resulted in the child's death. The man who murdered the child was sentenced to serve a minimum of 20 years for second degree murder. The mother's involvement in the crime is not reported, though she served 2 years probation for accessory after a plea deal for providing information about her then boyfriend who had committed the act.\n[\n28\n]\nArgentina, 2023\n[\nedit\n]\nA man was reported missing to the local police in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The family reported a possible suspect due to the fact the missing person and the suspect had intense arguments not long before his disappearance. The police searched the suspect's house and found bloodstains on clothing items under the bed. They then took clothing items of the suspect for evidence analysis and soil samples from the garden of the suspect's house. 25 days later, the police found the missing person's body 1000 meters off a coastline. Forensic mycology and palynology was then applied to analyze the palynomorphs and fungal species, as soil samples from the location of the corpse were analyzed. Samples were first acquired by scarping the surface area and then filtration and acetolysis was conducted to isolate the pollen samples. The analysis of the suspect's clothing was then compared to the analysis of the corpse and the surrounding area. Results indicated that the corpse had a palynomorph composition of marine species, the quantity and exact species of which were all documented. The soil from the suspect's house had a continental palynomorph composition that was also fully documented and recorded. The suspect's bloodstained clothing had the same marine palynomorph composition as the body and the surrounding area. Soil samples in the suspect's car and under the soles of the suspect's shoes also contained the same palynomorph composition as the coastline area where the body was found. Along with other forensic evidence, the suspect was found guilty and the use of forensic palynology was used to help close this case.\n[\n29\n]\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\ng\nh\ni\nj\nk\nl\nm\nMildenhall, D.
